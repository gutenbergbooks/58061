<h2><a name="I" id="I">I.</a></h2>


<p>It was in the autumn of 1861 that I made up my mind to
go to the Southern States of America, and enter the Confederate
Army. Looking back more than twenty years, I
find it difficult, as the man of forty-two, to recall the exact
feelings of the boy of twenty. I can say, however, that I
had no expectation whatever of any gain, or advantage to
myself. I had a sincere sympathy with the Southern
people in their struggle for independence, and felt that it
would be a pleasant thing to help them to secure their freedom.
It was not expected, at that time, that the war would
last many months, and my idea simply was to go to the
South, do my duty there as well as I might, and return
home to England. I expected no reward and wanted none,
and had no intention whatever of remaining permanently
in the Southern States.</p>

<p>There was much difficulty, of course, in obtaining accurate
information as to the best way of reaching the seat of war
in the South. I found that I could probably go by way of
Nassau, N. P., but the expense would have been greater
than I cared to incur, and the other mode of entering the
Confederacy&mdash;by going to a Northern port and slipping
through the lines&mdash;was exceedingly troublesome, and was,
besides, uncertain in its result. However, I determined to
go in some fashion, and just about this time the Confederate
States steamer <i>Nashville</i> arrived at Southampton. This
vessel had been one of the regular steamers on the line
between Charleston and New York, and was seized, I believe,
by the Confederate authorities after hostilities began.
It had been determined to send the Hon. James M. Mason
and the Hon. John Slidell to represent the Confederate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
States in England and France respectively, and the <i>Nashville</i>
was fitted out for the purpose of taking them to
England. They changed their plan, unfortunately for them,
and went in a small vessel to Havana, where they took
the mail steamer <i>Trent</i> for St. Thomas. The trip of the
<i>Nashville</i> was not, however, abandoned, and, under command
of Captain Robert B. Pegram, she ran the blockade at
Charleston and reached Southampton in safety, capturing
and destroying during the voyage a fine American ship
named the <i>Harvey Birch</i>.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>Nashville</i> at Southampton caused
considerable stir. By those who were friendly to the North
she was spoken of as a pirate, and her officers and crew were
dubbed buccaneers. While some of the newspapers were
disposed to order out Captain Pegram and his crew for
instant execution, there were others which were quite
friendly in tone. I remember that it became necessary for
Captain Pegram to write a letter to “<cite>The Times</cite>,” in which
he explained that, far from being “a pirate,” he was a
regularly commissioned officer of the Confederate States
Navy, and that the <i>Nashville</i> was a vessel of war of the Confederate
States, entitled to the consideration that would
be shewn to the war vessel of any other Government. This
view was taken by the English authorities, although, under
the proclamation of neutrality which the Queen had issued,
the <i>Nashville</i> was not allowed to obtain any sort of equipment
which could, by any stretch of the imagination, be
conceived to be capable of use in war. The authorities at
Southampton were so strict in their construction of the
neutrality proclamation that they objected to our strengthening
the forward deck, lest it might increase the efficiency of
the vessel for fighting purposes. No repairs were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to be made except such as would place the <i>Nashville</i> in the
precise condition in which she was when she left Charleston.
The passage had been rough, or no repairs of the kind
allowed would have been necessary. <cite>Punch</cite>, of course, made
fun of the whole business, and had some rhyming verses on
the subject, in which the name of Captain Pegram, the
commander of the <i>Nashville</i>, was made to rhyme with
“megrim.”</p>

<p>It occurred to me that if I could in any way secure a
passage to the South on the <i>Nashville</i>, it would be much
better than trying to get there by way of Nassau or the
Potomac. A man named Smith, to whom I was introduced
in London by a friend, and who told me that a near kinsman
of his was at that time, or had been, Governor of Arkansas,
gave me a letter of introduction to Mr. North,
who was one of the Confederate agents in London. I
saw Mr. North and told him what I wanted, but I do not
think that I made a very favorable impression. It seemed
to him so extravagant a project that he evidently doubted
my sincerity and honesty of purpose. The most that I
could accomplish was to obtain from him a note introducing
me to Captain Pegram. This was something gained, and a
few days afterwards I went to Southampton.</p>

<p>As I neared my destination, I was surprised to find how
large a share of public attention was given to the Confederate
vessel. The appearance of the <i>Nashville</i>, her size, her
speed, and the probable plans of her commander were
diligently canvassed by those traveling with me, and I was
gratified to find that every one had a good opinion of the
conduct and character of the officers and crew of the vessel.
Upon my arrival I went at once to the docks, and far in the
distance saw a flag which was entirely new and strange. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I drew nearer I found that it was flying from the peak of a
large paddle-wheel steamer, painted black, and with more
upper-works than I had been accustomed to see on sea-going
vessels. The flag that I had seen was the Stars and
Bars of the Confederacy, and the vessel was the <i>Nashville</i>.
I went aboard and to my great annoyance was told that Captain
Pegram was in London. The officer on duty was very
courteous and disposed to be communicative, and I had a
long talk with him. This officer was Lieutenant John J.
Ingraham, of Charleston, S. C. I learned that he was a
graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and it rather
daunted me to be told that one could not expect to attain
the rank of officer in the Navy unless one had had the
thorough training of a naval school, or practical education
at sea.</p>

<p>Some days later I went down to Southampton again, and
this time saw Captain Pegram. The sweetness and dignity
of his manner impressed me at once, and I unbosomed myself
to him without reserve. I may mention here that he
had been twenty-five or thirty years in the Navy when
Virginia seceded from the Union, and instantly resigned his
commission to share the fortunes of his native State. In
his profession he had already gained distinction, and I have
seen the sword of honor presented to him by the State of
Virginia in recognition of his gallantry in an engagement
with pirates in the Chinese Seas. On the golden scabbard
of this sword his name and rank are engraved, with this
simple but eloquent inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
“<em>The State of Virginia to a devoted son.</em>”</p>

<p>It need not be said that Captain Pegram was exceedingly
kind and patient, but he told me frankly that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for him to do what I wished. He said: “I have
no office which I can give you, and this being a Government
vessel, I cannot take you as a passenger.” Afterwards,
I learned that some of the officers suggested that I might
be a “Yankee spy” endeavoring to get into a position where
I should be able to report the movements of the <i>Nashville</i>
to her anxious friends on the other side. Amongst other
things, Captain Pegram told me that there would be plenty
of opportunities of reaching the South, as the United States
would certainly refuse to surrender Messrs. Mason and
Slidell [who had been taken from the English mail steamer
<i>Trent</i> by Captain Wilkes of the <i>San Jacinto</i>, on November
8th, 1861], and that England’s first act after declaring war
would be to raise the blockade of the Southern ports. In
spite of Captain Pegram’s refusal, I persisted in urging him
to take me, and at last he said: “There is only one thing
that can be done; if you like to go as a sailor before the
mast I will take you, but of course you will not dream of
doing that.” My answer was “I will do it; and I hope that
you will let me know when you are about to sail, in order that
I may be here in time.” Captain Pegram told me that he
would do this, but either forgot it or supposed that my
intentions must have changed when I realized what I had
undertaken. But I did not realize it, and I did not change
my mind. I ought to say here that, although I was twenty-one
years old at this time, I did not look more than seventeen
or eighteen, which will account for the habit that Captain
Pegram has had of saying that I was a mere boy at the
time that he made my acquaintance.</p>

<p>I returned to London, and began at once to make arrangements
for my departure. My friend from Arkansas told me
that the one indispensable thing was a bowie-knife, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
explained the divers uses to which this weapon could be
put, assuring me that I would have no difficulty in seizing
the gun of a Yankee soldier by the muzzle and, with one dexterous
blow, severing the barrel in twain. Another way of
using it was to attach a cord to the handle of this bowie-knife
and, with a skillful throw, to drive the blade into the
heart of the advancing foeman, and, when he should have
fallen, to haul it back by the string, and repeat the operation
on another of the enemy. I had not much faith in my
ability to use the bowie-knife in this fashion, but I ordered
one to be made by a surgical instrument maker, according to
a pattern given me by my Arkansas friend. A sanguinary
looking weapon it was. The blade was fifteen inches long and
about three inches wide, at the broadest part, and a third of
an inch thick at the back. I provided myself with a sea-chest,
which, according to Marryatt’s novels, was indispensable to
a sea-faring man, caused my name to be painted on it in big
white letters, and held myself in readiness to start. But no
summons came. The papers would occasionally say that the
<i>Nashville</i> was to sail in a day or two, and I had many a false
alarm. Tired of waiting, I bade good-bye to my people at
home, and went down to Southampton, determined to
remain there until the time for going aboard should come.</p>

<p>At Southampton I purchased a sailor’s outfit, and, when
I had rigged myself out in what I considered the proper
style, I went down to the vessel. I wore a blue woolen
shirt open at the neck; a black silk handkerchief, with ample
flowing ends, tied loosely around the neck; blue trousers,
made very tight at the knee and twenty-two inches in circumference
at the bottom, and on my head a flat cloth cap
ornamented with long black ribbons. I had besides, in the
famous sea-chest, a pea jacket, sea boots, and the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
under-clothing. As a reminder of my former estate, I retained
a suit of dress clothes, and a black Inverness cape
which I had been in the habit of wearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II.</a></h2>


<p>As well as I can remember, it was on New Year’s Day,
1862, that I went aboard the <i>Nashville</i>.</p>

<p>I reported to the officer of the deck, and told him that
I had been ordered by Captain Pegram to come aboard for
duty. I was turned over to the boatswain, who told me to
go down into the “foksle.” Up to this time I was supposed
to be, what I appeared to be, a sailor. As a matter of fact
my experience in nautical affairs had been confined to sailing
miniature yachts on the Serpentine in Hyde Park, but
I thought I had considerable theoretical knowledge obtained
from the romances of Marryatt and Chamier, and Dana’s excellent
book: “<cite>Two Years Before the Mast</cite>.”</p>

<p>Following my conductor, Mr. Sawyer, I tumbled down
the “companion,” and found myself in as pleasant a place
for being uncomfortable, as any one could desire.</p>

<p>The foksle, or forecastle, was about ten feet long, about five
feet six inches high, and about ten feet broad aft, and six feet
forward. The lack of height was an advantage to me, as
when the vessel rolled I could hold on with my head and
have my hands at liberty. On each side of the forecastle
were the bunks or “rabbit hutches” for the crew. In the
centre was a small table supported against the windlass bitt,
a heavy piece of timber which passed through the forecastle.
Around the bitt were hung a number of one-pronged forks,
notched knives, and battered spoons, matching each other
in only one thing&mdash;dirt. Twelve o’clock or “eight bells”
rang, and the crew came down to dinner. There were but
eight seamen on the <i>Nashville</i>, and they represented almost
as many different nations. There was an Irishman, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Belgian, a North Carolinian and a Swede, a fat Cockney
Englishman and a Frenchman, a Scotchman and a Spaniard.
I found them to be mean, treacherous and obscene, and I
shall say no more about them than is absolutely necessary.
The dinner on the first day will serve as a sample of our
usual diet, and of the crew’s habitual behavior. First, there
was a scramble for the knives, forks and spoons; then a
greasy boy brought down a large dish containing roast beef
and potatoes, and dumped it on the deck. The men clustered
around the dish. One of them seized the meat with his left
hand, hacked off a large piece with the dull knife in his right,
clutched a handful of potatoes out of the dish, and then retired
to a quiet corner with his prey. Each of the others did the
same. When my turn came I had no appetite, and, until I
left Southampton, my custom was to make up in town for
my enforced abstinence aboard ship. The food was good
in itself, and there was plenty of it, but it was wretchedly
served, as I have mentioned. A bunk was assigned me, but
I did not sleep much that first night. The next morning I
went to Mr. Sawyer, the boatswain, and asked him for something
to do. He proceeded to question me, found that I
knew nothing of a sea-faring life, and told me very frankly
that I was not worth my salt. However, he furnished me
with a bucket and some soap, and told me to go to work and
scour the paint. When I had amused myself with this for
some hours, I was given a rag and told to polish up the
brass-work. This ended, I occupied myself in sweeping
decks and cleaning out spittoons. This was about the daily
routine of my life on the <i>Nashville</i>. Usually only one man
was on watch at night, and this part of the duty I found
reasonably pleasant, as I could ensconce myself in the pilot
house and read a novel to pass away the time, when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
not required on deck. The officers, especially the younger
ones, were not particularly careful to return aboard at the
appointed time, and I suppose that the dignified Solicitor
of the Western Union Telegraph Company, Mr. Clarence
Cary, has forgotten how I have connived at his slipping
aboard, over the rail, when he had stayed in town longer
than was good for him. Every day or two I was allowed to
go ashore in the evening, and, leaving my sailor garb behind
me, I led, for a few hours, a pleasant life in town. Mr.
Sawyer, the boatswain, was very indignant one night, because
he took off his hat and made me a profound bow,
fancying that I was some distinguished visitor.</p>

<p>I think it was early in January, 1862, that a little commotion
was caused by the report that the United States sloop-of-war
<i>Tuscarora</i> had anchored in Southampton Water, and
that Captain Craven, who was in command, had announced
his intention to take the <i>Nashville</i> into either New York
or Boston. Neither of these ports was our destination.
Besides the eight seamen on the <i>Nashville</i>, we had about
thirty firemen and coal-heavers, and in officers we were particularly
rich, having, besides the Captain and Executive
Officer, a Sailing-master, Purser, Doctor and seven Midshipmen.
The men went ashore as often as they could obtain
leave, or steal off unobserved, and the <i>Tuscarora’s</i> men did
the same.</p>

<p>There was a Music Hall at Southampton in those days,
known as the “Rainbow” or the “Wheat Sheaf,” which,
being cheap and warm, was a favorite resort with us.
The entertainment was not of a high order, but it answered
the purpose. The sympathies of the Southampton
people were unquestionably with the Confederates, and the
<i>Tuscarora’s</i> men were thought very little of. They had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
hard time of it. When they went to the “Rainbow,” any
of the <i>Nashville’s</i> men who happened to be there was sure
to call out for the “Bonnie Blue Flag” or “Dixie,” which
was instantly played with the full force of the small orchestra,
amid the hurrahs of the audience. But if the <i>Tuscarora’s</i>
men ventured to suggest “Yankee Doodle” or “Hail Columbia,”
they were hooted down incontinently. Consequently,
fights were frequent, and, as the newspapers were friendly to
us, the “Yankees” were always the aggressors, and were
always the unfortunates to be locked up for the night, and
lectured and fined by the magistrate in the morning. I must
admit that we generally brought on the row ourselves, but,
when it was over, and the wrong men had been put in the
station house, we had the satisfaction of going down to
the <i>Nashville</i>, singing lustily and giving cheer after cheer
for the Southern Confederacy and Jeff Davis.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Captain Pegram had been in correspondence
with the English Government, with regard to the
threatening attitude of the <i>Tuscarora</i>, and it was announced
officially that neither vessel would be allowed to leave
Southampton within twenty-four hours after the departure
of the other. This was kind, for, although there were many
rumors concerning our armament, we really had but two guns,
(12 pound Blakeley’s) which had been lent to Captain Pegram
by Governor Pickens, of South Carolina. Soon rumors came
that we were about to sail in real earnest, and popular curiosity
was so stimulated that crowds of persons came down
from London to take a look at “the pirate.” Many of them
were disappointed at our peaceful appearance, but most of
them agreed that the vessel was appropriately painted black.
The <i>Nashville</i> was now hauled to the outer dock, and the
authorities were notified that we were ready to sail. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
appointed day was February 3, 1862, and thousands of persons,
including many of our warm Southampton friends,
thronged the docks. Amid cheers and waving handkerchiefs
and cordial Godspeeds, the <i>Nashville</i>, at about half-past
3 o’clock in the afternoon, under a full head of steam,
glided out into Southampton Water. Passing rapidly down
the channel, the Confederate flag flying at the fore and
mainmast, we saw lying off Osborne our old enemy, the
<i>Tuscarora</i>, with steam up, but alongside was lying the
British frigate <i>Shannon</i>, fully prepared to have a word to
say, if Captain Craven should attempt to sail before the
appointed time. This was some comfort to us, and we were
soon gently rising and falling on the waves of the broad
Atlantic.</p>

<p>I will give, at this place, some verses that I wrote at the
time, and which used to be sung aboard. The air, as well
as I remember, was very much like one that I had heard at
the “Rainbow.”</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III.</a></h2>


<p>The morning after our departure from Southampton, the
crew were mustered into the service of the Confederate
States and signed the articles. I was rated as a “landsman,”
or a “boy.” The crew were divided into two watches, and
the regular routine of duty at sea began. I found that I
had twelve hours on duty out of every twenty-four, and at
no time more than four consecutive hours to call my own.
For instance, to-day I would be on duty from 12 to 4 A. M.,
8 A. M. to 12 M., 4 to 6 P. M., and 8 to 12 P. M., and so on
in uninterrupted succession. This was rather hard work for
one who was fond of comfort and late breakfasts, but I speedily
learned not to lose any time in going to sleep, and undressing
appeared a useless indulgence. This was not the worst
of it. The wind was fair, and we had been running under
the foresail, foretopsail and spanker, when some evil genius
inspired the officer of the deck to order all hands aloft to
reef the foretopsail. Now I knew nothing of gymnastics.
I had never attempted to climb a greasy pole or a rope in
my life, and was unaccustomed to any more difficult mode of
reaching a given elevation than by the use of easy stairs,
with a strong baluster. The <i>Nashville</i> was rolling handsomely,
and I was not eager to respond to the call that had
been made, hoping that my assistance would not be needed
or expected by my hardy companions. But Sawyer, the
boatswain, had no idea of allowing me to escape in that way,
and enquired, in his usual polite way, whether I intended
to be all day making up my mind. I told him I thought
not, and started up the shrouds. Making a desperate effort
to be lively, I missed every second or third ratline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
scraped most of the skin off my shins. At last I reached
the mast-head and got on the topsail yard. My calculation
was that the best place for me was close to the mast, which
I might hug with one arm while I helped to manipulate
the flapping sail with the other; but the men who were up
there would not hear of this. With much profanity, they
told me that the proper place for me was out at the extreme
end of the yard. Suspended under the yards, as customary,
and parallel with it, was a foot rope. Planting my feet
squarely against this, and resting my chest upon the yard
and holding on like grim death with my hands, I got out to
the yard-arm, but here the foot rope was so close to the
yard that it was of little use to me. Just then one of the
men gave the rope a jerk. My heels went up and my head
went down, but I saved myself from falling by a violent
effort and trusted the foot rope no more. Using both
hands in lifting the sail, I balanced my body as well as I
could upon the yard, and at this moment I confess I would
not have given a sixpence for my chance of seeing the next
morning’s sun. I came down safe, however, as you perceive,
and more scared than hurt. The men said that I left the
marks of my fingers on the stays, and that the wood was indented
where I grasped the yard. After a while I became
accustomed to going aloft, although I never could make
myself believe that it was better to be at the yard-arm than
nearest the mast. The men were right, however, in regarding
the former as the easiest berth, as the weight of the
sail to be lifted is the least there.</p>

<p>The <i>Nashville</i> having been originally a passenger steamer,
as I have already mentioned, carried only enough coal in
the bunkers for six or eight days steaming, so we were soon
employed in hoisting coal from the lower hold forward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
running it aft to the bunkers. So long as the work was at
the windlass on deck I got along very well, but, when I was
sent down into the stifling atmosphere of the lower hold to
fill the baskets with coal, I quickly ended the difficulty by
fainting. When I revived, I went on deck and told Mr.
Sawyer what had taken place. As one of the officers whom
I knew was looking at him, he contented himself with saying
that “I was no account anyhow, and might as well stay
on deck.”</p>

<p>This is as good a place as any to give the names of the
officers: The commanding officer, as I said before, was Captain
Robert B. Pegram, of Virginia; the First Lieutenant
and Executive officer was Mr. Bennett; Lieutenant John J.
Ingraham, of South Carolina, was the Sailing-master; the
Second Lieutenant was Mr. Whittle, of Norfolk, Virginia;
Dr. John L. Ancrum, of Charleston, was the Surgeon; Mr.
Richard Taylor, of Norfolk, Virginia, was the Paymaster.
The Midshipmen were: Thomas, of Georgia; McClintock,
of Mississippi; J. W. Pegram (the Captain’s son), of Virginia;
Clarence Cary, of Virginia; Hamilton, of South Carolina;
Sinclair, of Virginia; Dalton, of Mississippi. The
Master-at-arms was Lewis Hill, of Richmond, Virginia.
We had aboard, also, a Charleston pilot, Captain James
Evans.</p>

<p>My intercourse with the officers was very pleasant while
at Southampton, and I was on excellent terms with Cary,
Pegram, Dalton, Hamilton and McClintock while we were
at sea. They were careful, of course, not to allow their
personal consideration for me to interfere in any way with
a proper regard for the discipline of the ship. Cary was
anxious to improve himself in French, and I gave him a
lesson nearly every day. To one of the other midshipmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
I gave some lessons in music. The sailors were very much
disgusted that any special kindness should be shown me,
and really, until we reached Bermuda, this kindness on the
part of the officers was confined necessarily to a friendly
nod, or other greeting, excepting when I was giving any
of the midshipmen such little assistance in French and music
as I have mentioned.</p>

<p>The second day after we left Southampton my trunk was
broken open and nearly everything I had in it was stolen
by the sailors. I complained to Mr. Bennett, who suggested
that I ought to have expected it, and should have been careful
to keep my trunk securely locked, or to have had in it
nothing that was worth stealing.</p>

<p>Captain Pegram did not appear to know that I was on
board until we had been several days at sea. I was engaged
one morning in sweeping the deck, or cleaning paint, when
he stepped out from the pilot house, and seemed to recognize
me. He nodded and said “good morning,” and that
was all. My heart sank and I felt forsaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.</a></h2>


<p>In order to baffle the <i>Tuscarora</i>, who was sure to pursue us,
Captain Pegram took a more northerly route than was usual;
and on the fourth or fifth day after sailing the wind freshened
sharply, and in a few hours blew with terrible force.
The ship was old, and unprepared for bad weather, and it
was not without anxiety that our officers saw the tempest approach.
In twenty-four hours the gale had reached its height.
The waves were running awfully high to my unaccustomed
eyes, and were battering the sides of the ship as though determined
to force an entrance. Nobly, however, did the
<i>Nashville</i> behave. There surely never was a better sea boat.
She shipped little water, and, although each wave that
struck her bows made her tremble and quiver from stem to
stern, she bore herself nobly in the unequal contest. Loose
spars, boxes, coils of rope and water-casks, which had been
improperly secured, were rolling about on deck, threatening
to break the legs of whoever should pass. The port bulwarks
from the heel of the bowsprit to the wheelhouse were
washed away flush with the deck. One angry wave carried
off the whole of the port wheelhouse and dashed to pieces
several of the “buckets,” or paddles. The saloon and the
forward cabin were several inches deep in water, and the
forecastle was in a worse plight. For days this continued.
The engines were slowed down, and we did no more than
hold our own. It would have been dangerous, lame as the
vessel was, to drive her in the teeth of the tempest. The
most grewsome part of it all was the unremitting tolling of
the forecastle bell, as the <i>Nashville</i> rose on the crest of the
wave and glided down, and down, into the trough of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="verse0">But still is heard, as seamen tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">When souls are lost, that warning bell.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>While the gale was at its height the engine broke down,
and sail was made to keep the vessel’s head to the wind.
The storm began to subside, and on the morning of the
eighth day the wind had lulled. The waves still ran high,
and for the first time I saw the beautiful effect of the dashing
of the spray over the rail of the vessel, forming miniature
rainbows arching to the deck and glowing and glittering
with prismatic colors.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to say at this point that I was very sea-sick
on the first day out, but, as Bo’sun Sawyer was constantly
after me to do some of the drudgery he had in mind for me,
I had no time to indulge in the pleasures of sea-sickness and
recovered entirely in less than twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>I had one very narrow escape during the gale. Crossing
the hurricane deck, I was thrown off my feet by a sudden
lurch of the vessel and went whirling to leeward. One of
my feet caught in the rail as I was lurching overboard, and
this was all that saved my Confederate career from being
brought to an untimely end.</p>

<p>When the weather grew fine, the crew were ordered out
for drill, and from the recesses of the hold our hidden armament
was produced. It consisted of about twenty rusty
smoothbore muskets. The muskets were given to the sailors
and firemen, who were then drilled in the manual of arms by
one of the officers. There was a good deal of difference of
opinion as to what the commands meant, and the whole
affair was very much of a burlesque, as every now and then
a sudden lurch of the vessel would send three or four of the
squad staggering down to leeward. When the command
was given, Ready! Aim! and every musket was levelled
at our instructor’s head, the startled officer called out hastily:
“For Heaven’s sake, men, don’t point your guns at me!
They are loaded!” The warning was not given too soon,
for, as they were dismissed, two of the men rolled into the
scuppers, their pieces going off with a very ugly report.
That was the first and the last of the drilling.</p>

<p>Although he had made no sign, Captain Pegram had
not forgotten me. When we had been out seven or
eight days, the Master-at-arms went to the boatswain and
told him that I and a man named Lussen were to take
one of the staterooms on the hurricane deck. This was
paradise to me, for I had there every convenience that I
required, and could escape from the loathsome company of
the rest of the crew. Lussen was a singular character. He
was evidently a thoroughly instructed sea-faring man and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
good navigator. He had his sextant with him. According
to his own account he had been an officer in the Navy of
one of the South American Republics, and expected on
reaching the Confederacy to get an appointment in the Confederate
service. Being a very intelligent man, pleasing in
his manners and not at all coarse, he was a welcome room-mate
and an acceptable companion. Our separation from
the rest of the crew did not strengthen the men’s kindly
feeling for us, and they lost no opportunity of showing their
spite and their disgust. One thing they insisted on, and
that was that we should go down to the forecastle for our
meals. A favorite dish once or twice a week was plum-duff,
but the plums were so scarce that one of the men said that
he could hear one plum singing this little song to another:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Here am I! Where are you?</p>
<p class="verse0">Tell me where to find you.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter that I wrote to my mother from Bermuda, I
described our change of quarters as follows: “Our state-room
on the upper deck has two bunks and a toilet stand,
and is very prettily painted. Through the windows we can
look at the open sea. What a contrast to the den that we
did inhabit! When work is over I can have the blessedness
of being alone. More than this: one of the Midshipmen
told me that he heard Captain Pegram and Mr. Bennett
talking about me, and Captain Pegram said he was very
much pleased with my conduct.”</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V">V.</a></h2>


<p>On the evening of the 19th of February we were told that
we might expect to make land the next morning, and as
soon as the sun rose every one was on the lookout. In an
hour or two land was in sight on the port bow, and even my
unskilled eye could make out what seemed to be a long dark
cloud on the horizon. Gradually the land became distinct,
and by noon we were lying off Bermuda signaling for a
pilot. The general aspect of the island was far from inviting,
as nothing could be seen but rugged hills covered
with dwarfed trees, and I looked in vain for the fine harbor
of which I had heard so much. A boat with four negroes,
who were making considerable fuss, came alongside with a
splash, and, in great state, the black pilot clambered up the
side and took his place in the pilot house. He understood
his business. The <i>Nashville</i> ran squarely towards the island as
though she was to be thrown upon the rocks. Then a narrow
passage between two lofty hills was visible, and into this we
steamed. Above our heads on each side towered the rocks,
and the passage was so narrow that the yards seemed to
scrape the trees on either side as we passed in. The passage
gradually opened, and we dropped anchor in the beautiful
harbor of St. George’s. This harbor is, without exception,
the most beautiful and picturesque that I have ever
seen. There was not a ripple on the water, while dotting
its brightly blue bosom in every direction were hundreds
of islands, some of them of considerable size and others
mere spots upon the placid surface of the harbor. The
surrounding hills were adorned with houses built of white
stone and shining like snow in the light of the sun. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
highest point was the signal station, where floated the red
cross of St. George. It was near the end of February, yet
the weather was warm and the sky was unclouded. It
was hard to realize that only a few days before we had
left cold fogs and drizzling rain in England.</p>

<p>The principal object in calling at Bermuda was to obtain
a supply of coal, and Captain Pegram made a bargain with
the master of a Yankee bark then in the harbor for as much
as we needed. I think the coal had been intended to supply
United States cruisers which were expected to stop at St.
George’s, but the high price we offered was too much for
the patriotism of the master of the bark. I had a great
desire to go ashore and see what Bermuda looked like, but
this privilege was denied me as Bo’sun Sawyer found
abundant occupation for the whole of us in shovelling coal
and then scrubbing the paint. I was allowed on Sunday to
be one of the boat’s crew who went to the landing to bring
off Captain Pegram, who had gone to church, and I had the
satisfaction of waiting there in the sun for two or three
hours and of being roundly abused, by the rest of the crew,
for “catching crabs” in the most awkward manner as we
rowed back to the <i>Nashville</i>.</p>

<p>Up to this time Captain Pegram had not determined positively
whether he would run into Charleston, Savannah or
New Orleans, and the information which he obtained at
Bermuda satisfied him that these ports could only be reached
with great difficulty, as the blockade had now become rigid.
A ship captain whom he talked with informed Captain
Pegram that he thought we might run into Beaufort, N. C.,
with comparative ease, and it was determined to try our fortune
there.</p>

<p>After leaving Bermuda I was relieved from some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
scrubbing and cleaning, and was allowed to take my turn
as lookout, being posted for two hours at a time on the foretopsail
yard. There I had the pleasantest hours that I
knew on the <i>Nashville</i>. It was quiet and still. I was far
removed from the bickering and blackguardism of the crew,
and could indulge myself freely in watching the varied hues
of the dancing waters, broken now and again by a shoal of
porpoises, or by the brief flight of the flying-fish as they
darted from the wave in the effort to escape from their
pursuers. But all this was not conducive to keeping a sharp
lookout. The second day after leaving Bermuda I was
busily thinking of what might happen when we should reach
our destination. The hail came from below: “Foretopsail
yard there!”</p>

<p>I answered promptly “aye! aye! sir.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you reported that sail?”</p>

<p>I looked around the horizon and replied: “I have not
seen a sail this morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not! come on deck!”</p>

<p>When I reached the deck I was received with a grin of
derision, and found that a fine schooner was running under
full sail within half a mile of us. I had looked too far.
Every one too had been busy while I was dreaming aloft.
The American flag was flying at our peak, and the men were
now sent to the guns. A boat’s crew was called away, and,
eager to atone for my neglect, I jumped in. We pulled
over to the schooner, which was now lying to, boarded her,
and found her to be the <i>Robert Gilfillan</i>, from Boston to
Hayti, with an assorted cargo. The master, a loquacious
down-easter, was led to believe that the <i>Nashville</i> was the
United States steamer <i>Keystone State</i>, and he invited the
officer in charge of the boat to take breakfast with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The hot rolls looked most tempting, and the fragrance of
the coffee was particularly tantalizing. The master, whose
name was Gilfillan, told us that everything was going on
splendidly for “the Union,” and that the Union troops had
been “whipping the bloody Rebels like forty.” In fact,
“the Rebellion was nearly played out.” Lieutenant Ingraham,
who was in command of the boat, very quietly said:
“Haul down your flag and take your papers aboard my
ship immediately.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Captain Gilfillan.</p>

<p>The answer came promptly: “That vessel is the Confederate
States steamer <i>Nashville</i>, and you are my prisoner.”</p>

<p>The poor fellow was part-owner of the schooner, and I
shall not soon forget the mingled dismay and astonishment
on his face. But resistance was useless, and he did as he
was ordered. All our boats were now lowered, and everything
of value, the bells, chronometer, glasses and nautical
instruments, some provisions, brooms and a lot of “notions,”
were taken aboard the <i>Nashville</i>. The schooner was then
set on fire, and in a few hours had burned to the water’s
edge. For some days the hearts of the crew were gladdened
by the fresh butter and choice Boston crackers which formed
part of the stores of the ill-fated <i>Gilfillan</i>. The master and
crew were given as comfortable quarters as we had, and all
possible care was taken of them.</p>

<p>As we neared Beaufort every light was carefully covered
at night, even the binnacle lamps being masked. At midnight
we hove to for soundings, and found that we might
expect to make land by daybreak. The men seemed to
think that we should certainly be captured, and packed up
their clothing in their bags ready for a run. No one slept
much that night, and as soon as the fog lifted in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
every eye was on the alert. Beaufort harbor was plainly
visible some miles distant, and we saw, besides, what we did
not care to see. “Sail astern!” shouted the lookout; and
then came the cry: “Sail on the starboard bow!” and then
again: “Sail on the port bow.” Things looked rather blue.
The vessel astern did not cause us much anxiety, but the
blockaders on our port and starboard bows, although not
directly in our course, were so far ahead that if we attempted
to run in we might expect to be cut off. But Captain Pegram
was prepared for the emergency. “The Stars and Stripes”
were run up at the mainmast head, and a small private
signal of Messrs. Spofford &amp; Tileston, the former agents of
the vessel, was run up at the foremast. Our course was then
changed so that we headed for the nearer of the two United
States vessels. The “Stars and Stripes” were displayed by
them, in response to our flags, and a vigorous signaling began.
It was plain that the blockader could not make out
the meaning of Spofford &amp; Tileston’s pennant. On we went
without heeding this until Beaufort harbor was not more
than five or six miles distant on our starboard bow. We
could see the officers on the quarter-deck of the blockader,
and the men at the guns. The engines were slowed down,
and we blew off steam. The blockader nearest to us thought
that we had something to communicate, and lowered a boat.
As this was done, we hove round, the “Stars and Stripes”
came fluttering to the deck, and the Confederate flag was
run up at the foremast, the mainmast and the peak. With
all the steam we could carry, we dashed on towards Beaufort.
The Yankee now saw the trick, and fired a broadside at us.
No harm was done. She followed rapidly, firing occasionally
from the bow guns; but without injury we
crossed the bar under the protection of the guns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Fort Macon, and came safely to anchor near the railroad
wharf, at Morehead City. For a little while we were in
more danger from our friends than from the enemy. The
commandant at Fort Macon took us for one of the enemy’s
vessels, and was about to open on us with his heavy guns,
when one of his officers suggested that, as we were running
towards the fort, they might as well wait until we were
somewhat nearer. This proved our salvation. Before we
had reached the point where they could effectively fire at
us from the fort, we had shown our true colors and given
the blockader the benefit of a clear pair of heels. It was a
beautifully calm morning, and the <i>Nashville</i> surpassed herself.
In splendid sailing trim and with little or no cargo,
she must have made sixteen or eighteen knots as we ran into
the harbor.</p>

<p>On the <i>Nashville</i> now all was joy, for the blockader
attempted no further pursuit. The men hurrahed, and
the officers tossed up their caps and congratulated each
other on our success. Well they might. They were
looking forward to a speedy reunion with their families
and their friends. For the first time I realized my isolated
position. There was no home or friends for me; nothing
but doubt and uncertainty, yet I had confidence that with
time, faith and energy, I might accomplish what I desired.
The day, a pregnant one for me, was February 28, 1862.</p>

<p>Morehead City is not a large place. In fact, it consisted in
1862 of a railroad depot at the end of a long wharf. It was
intended to be the great seaport of North Carolina, but, at
this time, trade had refused to move out of its accustomed
channel, and the only thing that gave the least shadow of
animation to the place was the arrival and departure of the
daily train with its few passengers for Beaufort, which lies
across the Bay, a few miles distant. The railroad, which has
its terminus at Morehead City, runs up to Goldsboro’, where
it connects with the main line of the Wilmington and Weldon
Railroad. The <i>Nashville</i> was hauled alongside the
wharf, and, as there was a faint expectation that the boats
of the blockaders outside might come up at night and
attempt to cut us out, preparations were made for a defence.
The two Blakeley guns were placed on the wharf, and the
muskets of which mention has been made before were
brought up from the hold and prepared for use. The invaders,
however, did not come, and there was nothing to
disturb the solitude of the place but the occasional visit of
gaunt North Carolina soldiers, attired for the most part in
“butternut,” otherwise homespun. They were in the Confederate
service, and on duty in the neighborhood. Most of
them were armed with flint-lock muskets or shot guns, and
some of them carried huge bowie-knives made out of scythe
blades. They were generally tall, sinewy fellows, and evidently
accustomed to exertion and privation, but they were
not the sort of troops that I had expected to find the Confederate
army composed of. A group of them honored
the <i>Nashville</i>, when she came in, with the true Confederate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
yell, which I then heard for the first time, and without admiring
it.</p>

<p>As soon as I could obtain permission, I went up to Morehead
City proper, if the Railroad station at the water’s edge
is not to pass by that name, and found there five or six
wooden houses, a bar-room and the inevitable hotel. The
clearing was small, and the pine woods came up to within
a few yards of the hotel door. It was a barren country,
and a joke among the sailors was that the hogs were so
miserably poor that knots were tied in their tails by their
prudent owners to keep them from slipping through the
fences. Another story was that when a dog, in that part
of North Carolina, found it necessary to bark, he leaned
against a fence to keep from falling.</p>

<p>Captain Pegram went to Richmond to make his report,
and took with him a number of mysterious boxes which
had been brought aboard at Southampton. There was
much speculation as to their contents, but I believe that
they held nothing more dangerous than bank-note paper,
postage stamps and lithographing apparatus. I remained
aboard, of course, and there was little if any change in the
routine of duty. There was paint to clean, and there were
decks to sweep; the sails were to be unbent and sent below.
I cannot say that my value as a sailor had increased
materially during the voyage, and I had not even learned
to tie, with any certainty, a fast knot. On the hurricane
deck, as is usual on steamers, there was a score or two of
wooden buckets for fire purposes. They were used occasionally
for dipping up water. I tried my hand at it several
times, while the vessel was in motion, and, when the
bottom of the bucket was not driven out or the handle did
not give way, I found, to my dismay, that I had made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
slippery hitch, and saw the bucket slip smoothly into the
water as soon as the strain came upon the line. Some of
the men made handsome buckets of canvas, which they
carefully embroidered, and I was not much more lucky
with these than I was with the wooden ones. I have mentioned
how beautifully clear the water was in the harbor at
St. George’s, Bermuda, and the time with me never seemed
to pass more slowly than when one of these fancy buckets
had escaped from my line and was settling down in the
water, and I had an agonizing expectation that Sawyer
would reach the spot where I was standing before it had
gone completely out of sight. I think that, at a moderate
calculation, I must be responsible to the Confederacy for
a dozen wooden buckets besides several canvas buckets.</p>

<p>It was now time that I should determine what to do.
The small newspaper published at Newbern, N. C., reached
us occasionally, and from this we received the first news of
the glorious victory of the <i>Virginia</i> in the fight at Hampton
Roads, when she sank the <i>Cumberland</i> and the <i>Congress</i>.
There was great jubilation aboard that day. In the newspaper
I found appeals for volunteers for different companies
then raising for the war. I cannot give a better idea of my
frame of mind than by saying that, at this time, I had determined
to take my discharge from the <i>Nashville</i>, and decide,
by tossing-up, which one of the various companies
named in the newspaper I should join. I expected nothing
better.</p>

<p>There was a surprise in store for me. One furiously cold
morning, immediately after the return of Captain Pegram
from Richmond, I was scraping the fore-yard, wet through
with the falling sleet and intensely uncomfortable, when one
of the boys from the ward-room came forward and called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
me to say that I was wanted in the saloon. I went below at
once, and into the saloon, where I found Captain Pegram,
who spoke very kindly, and told me that, when I first came
aboard, he had thought that I was not serious in my avowed
purposes, and that, for this reason, he had done nothing
to encourage me; but that he and his officers had watched
me very closely, and were so well pleased with my conduct
that he had laid my case before the Secretary of the Navy,
who had authorized him to appoint me a Master’s Mate in
the Confederate Navy. This announcement, so entirely
unexpected, and which bridged for me, in a moment, the
gulf which, aboard ship, separates the sailor from the officer,
completely overwhelmed me. Captain Pegram saw my agitation,
and told me that he should expect me to mess with
him while we remained aboard, and that he would have my
trunk placed in a state-room which he had ordered to be
prepared for me. I went forward, thrust off my sailor’s
garb as rapidly as I could, put on the solitary civilian’s suit
which remained to me, and then was ready to receive the
kind congratulations of the officers and the effusive demonstrations
of regard of the truculent boatswain. Sawyer
told me that he was delighted to hear of my promotion,
which was just what he had expected, as he had always
seen that I was not in the position that I ought to hold!
Much to my regret I did not have the satisfaction of meeting
Mr. Sawyer again after I left the <i>Nashville</i>, when I
might have had the pleasure of telling him precisely what
I thought of him and his ways. My only reply to his congratulations
was to ask to be permitted to pay for the buckets
I had disposed of in the ways I have described. He said
it was of “no consequence.”</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII.</a></h2>


<p>What the precise position and duties of a Master’s Mate
were in the old navy I am not able to say. Indeed, I don’t
think I ever asked. In the Confederate Navy the Master’s
Mate had the same duties and the same nominal rank as a
Midshipman, and wore the same uniform. The only difference
was the very essential one that the pay of the Master’s
Mate was about $25 a month, while that of a Midshipman
was about $40.</p>

<p>My worst troubles were now over. Captain Pegram told
me that, as there was no special duty for me aboard, he would
ask me to prepare, under his direction, his report of the
voyage. This I did. It is worth remembering, too, that I
had the pleasure of writing, in his name, a letter of thanks
to Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, for the loan of the
Blakeley guns which had constituted our armament. I
remember that it was in this letter that Captain Pegram
said that it was by means of these guns that the <i>Nashville</i>
had been able to capture the <i>Harvey Birch</i> and the <i>Robert
Gilfillan</i>, and had been able to show her teeth to the enemy.
The last shot that we fired with these guns was at the blockaders
as we ran into Beaufort. The shell fell short, but it
was a sort of crow of defiance, and relieved our feelings
somewhat.</p>

<p>I learned that the <i>Nashville</i> had been sold to a mercantile
firm, and would be left at Morehead City in charge of
two officers and three or four men, until the new owners
should take possession of her. The rest of the crew were
to be discharged, and the officers were to be sent to other
posts of duty. I was ordered to report for duty to Commodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Forrest, at Norfolk, Va., to which point Captain
Pegram was to go to take command of an iron-clad then
building. To crown my satisfaction, Captain Pegram told
me that he intended to make a visit to his family, in Sussex
County, Virginia, and would be glad if I should accompany
him, and remain with him until it was necessary to go to
Norfolk.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1862, we bade good-bye to the <i>Nashville</i>.
Shortly after our departure the enemy moved in force upon
Newbern, and, to escape capture, Lieutenant Whittle and
Midshipman Sinclair took the <i>Nashville</i> out to sea. They
had but three or four men aboard, and were, I believe, without
charts or chronometers. They ran down to Charleston,
and being unable to get into that port, went to Savannah,
where they succeeded in running the blockade. It was a
daring feat most successfully accomplished, and reflected
the highest credit on the officers and men. The <i>Nashville</i>
lay in the Ogeechee river until 1863, when she was named
the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, and was made ready for sea as one of the
vessels of the Volunteer Navy then forming. But a Federal
gunboat succeeded in setting her on fire with shells thrown
across the marsh to the point where she lay, and she burned
to the water’s edge and sank. This was the end of as fine
a sea-boat as was ever built.</p>

<p>On taking the train to Goldsboro’ I found that the passport
system was in full operation, and, as I was in civilian’s
dress, the guard declined to allow me to pass. Captain
Pegram, however, told the guard that he would “endorse”
me, and I went on without molestation. Of course I made
all manner of queer blunders. Everything was so strange.
The nocturnal noise of the tree frogs caused me to tell
Captain Pegram in the morning that it was the only country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that I had ever been in where the birds sang all night.
I had not then been kept awake, hour by hour, by the melodious
warbling of the mocking bird.</p>

<p>It was a little after daylight when we reached Stony
Creek, on the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, where we
were to leave the train. Taking a carriage after breakfast,
we drove through the woods and plantations to the residence
of Major Belsches, with whom Captain Pegram’s
family were staying. Two or three miles before reaching
it, we passed by a handsome residence in the midst of a
large and well-ordered plantation, which I was told belonged
to Mr. Nat. Raines, a wealthy planter, who was an old
friend of Captain Pegram’s. At the house of Major Belsches
we found Mrs. Pegram, her two daughters and her
two younger sons. Every one was as kind as possible, and
the time for our departure for Norfolk came far too soon.
Before going there&mdash;indeed, the very day after our arrival&mdash;I
was taken over to the residence of Mr. Raines, to be introduced
to him and his family. He seemed to take quite a
fancy to me, and in the course of a few hours I was on a
friendly footing with the whole family. Nat. Raines, Jr.,
and Dr. B. F. Raines, the sons of Mr. Raines, were in the
cavalry service, and, at this time, at home on furlough.
Mrs. Raines was quiet, gentle and motherly, and her
two daughters I found to be amiable and accomplished.
One joke that Mr. Raines had was to tell me that he was
fonder of smoking than I, and could out-smoke me. The
tournament that followed resulted in my ignominious defeat.
The weapons were Powhatan clay pipes with long
reed stems, charged with tobacco grown on the plantation.
Mr. Raines carried a supply of it usually in his coat pocket.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII.</a></h2>


<p>Arrived at Norfolk, I reported to Commodore Forrest,
and was ordered by him to go aboard the <i>Confederate States</i>,
the receiving ship. This was a line-of-battle ship, named
formerly the <i>United States</i>, which had escaped destruction
by the Federals upon their evacuation of the navy yard.
On the receiving ship, where there were a number of officers
awaiting orders, I had my first experience of a hammock.
Like one of the heroes of my favorite Marryatt, I signalized
my entrance into the hammock on one side by pitching out
on my head on the other side. Unlike Marryatt’s heroes,
however, no shot-box with a sharp edge had been kindly
placed on the deck, by a sympathizing mess-mate, to meet
my descending skull. Having little to do aboard, I made
the acquaintance of Captain James Barron Hope, who was
acting as Commodore Forrest’s Secretary, and assisted him
in the discharge of his pleasant duties. Captain Hope is
widely known as a writer of both fervent verse and delightful
prose. He has been for some years the proprietor and
editor of the Norfolk <cite>Landmark</cite>, which is published at Norfolk,
where he lives. His latest literary work is the noble
Centennial Ode which was read last year at the celebration
at Yorktown.</p>

<p>Having provided myself with the gray uniform of the
Confederate Navy, I was taken to see Commodore Franklin
Buchanan, who commanded the <i>Virginia</i> in her first fight,
when he was severely wounded. The <i>Virginia</i> was in dock,
and was being put in order for another cruise; and Commodore
Buchanan was deeply chagrined at the prospect that
she might be ready before he had recovered. On March 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Commodore Josiah Tatnall was placed in command of the
squadron at Norfolk.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the <i>Virginia</i>, but those who
saw her will agree, I think, that it was marvellous that she
should have accomplished what she did. The plating consisted
of railroad iron rolled flat, and the bends were protected
by iron knuckles. There was no plating below the water-line,
and the prow with which she did so much execution did
not look much more dangerous than a champagne bottle,
which, in shape, it resembled. The great defect of the
<i>Virginia</i>, however, was the weakness of her engines, which
prevented her from manoeuvering rapidly, and which placed
her at so terrible a disadvantage in the fight with the Monitor.
The engines broke down frequently while she was in
the United States service. Their peculiar construction,
taken in connection with the great draft of the vessel,
twenty-two feet, and her length, three hundred and twelve
feet, rendered her management in narrow channels and in
presence of the enemy a very difficult matter.</p>

<p>The Confederate fleet at Norfolk consisted of the <i>Virginia</i>,
eight guns; the <i>Patrick Henry</i>, eight guns; the <i>Jamestown</i>,
two guns; and the <i>Beaufort</i>, the <i>Raleigh</i> and the <i>Teaser</i>, one
gun each. The <i>Patrick Henry</i> and <i>Jamestown</i> were ordinary
river steamboats, hastily and rudely adapted to the reception
of heavy guns; while the <i>Raleigh</i>, the <i>Beaufort</i> and
the <i>Teaser</i> were small and weak tug-boats. An ordinary
rifle ball would have perforated the boiler of the war-tugs,
and a shell from a field-piece, if it hit at all, would be tolerably
sure to send any one of them to the bottom. With
this fleet, however, it was determined to attack the Monitor
and the other United States vessels of war near Fortress
Monroe. I volunteered for service in the fleet, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
assigned to duty on the <i>Beaufort</i>, which was commanded
by Lieutenant W. H. Parker, one of the finest officers in
the Navy. Picked men from the infantry regiments stationed
at Norfolk were placed on each of the vessels; and,
the <i>Virginia</i> now being in tolerable order again, the whole
fleet, on the morning of April 11, 1862, steamed past Norfolk,
and gaily down the river, the <i>Virginia</i> leading the line.
The wharves along the river were crowded with ladies and
soldiers. Hats were tossed in the air, handkerchiefs were
waved, and cheer after cheer rent the air. The enthusiasm
of the hour made every one feel like a hero. Captain
Parker told me that the main object of the expedition was
the capture and destruction of the Monitor. Commodore
Tatnall was desperately in earnest, and one of the midshipmen
of the <i>Virginia</i> told me that he heard the old Commodore
say, as he stumped up and down the quarter-deck,
gritting his teeth: “I will take her! I will take her! if
h&mdash;ll’s on the other side of her.” The “her” was understood
to be the Monitor. The plan of operations was bold
and simple. When the Monitor came out to meet us, the
<i>Patrick Henry</i>, the <i>Jamestown</i>, the <i>Beaufort</i> and the <i>Raleigh</i>,
at a signal from the <i>Virginia</i>, were to run down upon the
enemy, endeavoring to strike her on the bows and quarter.
The Monitor was to be mobbed by the gun-boats while the
<i>Virginia</i> engaged her attention. On each of the Confederate
vessels boarding parties were detailed with prescribed
duties. Those numbered one in each vessel were provided
with hammers and wedges, and were to endeavor to chock
the turret of the Monitor so as to prevent it from revolving,
in which case her line of fire could only be changed by moving
the vessel. Those numbered two were supplied with balls
of tow, steeped in turpentine, which were to be ignited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thrown down the ventilators, which were then to be covered.
Those numbered three were to throw a wet sail over the pilot-house
so as to blind the helmsman. Meanwhile other boarders,
armed with pistols and cutlasses, were to guard against
any attempt on the part of the enemy’s crew to escape
from the confinement which was prepared for them. I had
command of the boarders on the <i>Beaufort</i>. The general
idea was that the Monitor would be overwhelmed by the
combined attack; and that by the means indicated we
could prevent her from doing much harm. The <i>Virginia</i>
would play an important part by endeavoring to ram her,
and we hoped to be able, with our four boarding steamers,
to take the Monitor in tow and haul her back to Norfolk,
when we might break her open, and take the crew prisoners
at our leisure. Commodore Tatnall expected that probably
half his gun-boats would be sunk or crippled in the attempt,
but he was quite sure of throwing on the deck of the Monitor
men enough to ensure her capture. It is just as likely
that the Monitor would have towed us to Fortress Monroe,
if she had not sunk the whole concern before we reached
her. The weather was dirty, and we lay at anchor during
the night off Craney Island. Betimes the next morning we
dropped down to Hampton Roads. The enemy’s batteries
fired several shots at us without effect. We could see that
the Monitor had steam up, and was lying close under the
protection of the batteries. She looked like a huge black
plate with a cheese box of the same color upon it. The
flag ship <i>Minnesota</i>, with a large number of men-of-war and
merchantmen, was below the forts. Signal guns were fired,
and we hoped that the enemy would engage us. The day
wore on and still the Monitor and her consorts skulked
under the guns of the forts. The <i>Virginia</i> ran within range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the formidable fortress, and then fired a gun of defiance,
but the Monitor would not come to the scratch. Within
the bar at Hampton three merchant vessels were lying,
and the <i>Jamestown</i> and <i>Raleigh</i> ran in, captured them and
brought them out. This exploit, almost within gunshot of
the Monitor, did not affect her movements. We did not
get the fight we sought. It was a terrible disappointment.
But in the critical condition in which the United States
Navy was at the time, it was the wiser part for the Monitor
to decline the engagement. Had we succeeded in disabling
her, the whole coast would have been at the mercy of the
<i>Virginia</i>. Obstructions had already been placed in the
Potomac in expectation of a naval raid on Washington, and
there was considerable perturbation at New York and Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX.</a></h2>


<p>On April the 17th I received orders to proceed to Petersburg,
and join Captain Pegram there. The iron-clad which
was building at Norfolk was not likely to be ready for several
months; and, as Captain Pegram was anxious to be in
active service, he was assigned to the command of the iron-clad
<i>Louisiana</i>, which was building at New Orleans, and said
to be nearly finished. With his usual kindness he caused
me to be ordered to the same vessel, and asked me to go
down with him. My first visit to the “Cockade City” was
a very agreeable one, as I made acquaintance there with a
number of Captain Pegram’s relatives, including his niece,
Mrs. Annie T. White, and his sister, Mrs. David May.</p>

<p>From Petersburg the journey by railroad to Louisiana
was dreary and monotonous in the extreme. I have a bare
recollection of being invited at Kingville, S. C, to go to the
end of the station and inspect an astonishingly fat hog,
which was the wonder of that part of the country. There
really was no other incident of note that I recall, except
the frequent delays, and the arrival at different points too
late for the connecting trains. As we neared our destination,
the air was full of ugly rumors. We learned that the
United States fleet had attacked the forts below New Orleans,
and it was reported that the city had been evacuated.
But we pressed on, and finally reached Jackson, Miss., where
we were told that it was no use to go any further. No passenger
trains were now running, but we succeeded in getting
on a train that was going down, and got within twenty miles
of New Orleans. There the cars were stopped; and in a
short time train after train came up from the city, bringing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Confederate troops, under command of General Mansfield
Lovell, and such stores as could be carried off. A number
of the soldiers who belonged to the “Garde d’Orleans,”
flatly refused to go any further, and, to my surprise, were
allowed to return to the city, which was now in the possession
of Butler’s forces. There was no choice for us but to
go back to Virginia; and Captain Pegram took charge of dispatches
from General Lovell, giving an account of the disaster.
So it turned out that, by stopping a day or two at
Petersburg, we had missed an opportunity of participating
in one of the fiercest naval fights of the war. The vessel
which Captain Pegram was to have commanded was taken
down the river in an unfinished condition, and was either
sunk or was blown up. The journey back was worse than
the journey down, as the delays were multiplied. It was on
the train, soon after leaving Lovell’s troops at Tangipahoa,
that I first met Colonel James M. Morgan (then a midshipman),
whose sister I afterwards married. The vessel on
which he was serving, the <i>McRae</i>, was lost in the engagement,
and he made his escape from the city with great difficulty.</p>

<p>When we reached North Carolina there was no comfort
there. Norfolk had been evacuated by the Confederate
forces, and the <i>Virginia</i> had been destroyed to prevent her
from falling into the hands of the enemy. I received permission
to rest in Sussex for a few days, and then went to
Richmond, where I was assigned to duty on a floating battery
lying in the James River, and commanded by Captain
Parker, with whom I had served on the <i>Beaufort</i>. This so-called
battery was a large flat, with a shield heavily plated
with iron in front. The name of the battery was the
<i>Drewry</i>, and she lay at Rockett’s, below Richmond. I had
fancied that she was a vessel of the same class as the <i>Virginia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and when I went down to the place where she lay I
looked about vainly for the vessel. Hailing a man who was
at work on what I supposed to be a dredge, I asked which
was the <i>Drewry</i>. “This is she,” said he. I was both disappointed
and disgusted. The <i>Drewry</i> was really a lighter,
about eighty feet long and fifteen feet broad, and was intended
to be loaded down within eight or ten inches of the
water. She had a wooden shield, V shaped, covered with
heavy iron bars, and in the angle of the shield was cut a
port-hole for her one heavy gun. She had no engines or
sails, and was to be towed or allowed to drift into position
when an engagement was expected.</p>

<p>I engaged quarters at a very pleasant house in Franklin
Street, and found amongst the boarders there the mother
and sister of Clarence Cary, whom I had known on the
<i>Nashville</i>. The sister, Miss Constance Cary, married, after
the war, Mr. Burton N. Harrison, who was the private secretary
of President Davis. Miss Constance Cary, or Miss
“Connie,” as she was usually called, wrote a good deal in
war times under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of “Refugitta;” and
during the last few years has written at least one very
charming society novel, besides an admirable work on
household decoration. There were also there, in the pleasant
company, Miss Hettie Cary, the famous Baltimore
beauty, and her sister, Miss Jennie Cary, a handsome woman,
and unfailingly amiable. Of course she was overshadowed
by her sister; and she used to say that the only
inscription necessary for her tomb-stone would be: “Here
lies the sister of Hetty Cary, the lady who presented
the Confederate colors to Beauregard’s troops at Manassas.”
Miss Hetty Cary, late in the war, married General John W.
Pegram, a nephew of Captain R. B. Pegram. A fight took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
place two or three weeks after her marriage, and Mrs. Pegram
went immediately to the front to assist in caring for
the wounded. Almost the first man who was brought up,
as she reached the field hospital, was her dead husband.
The Carys and Captain Pegram’s sister-in-law, Mrs. General
Pegram, and her daughters, Miss Mary and Miss Virginia
Pegram, were as kind and considerate to me as if I had
been a member of their family. To one of Captain Pegram’s
nephews, Willie Pegram, the youngest son of Mrs.
General Pegram, I became very warmly attached. He was
at this time particularly boyish looking, and wore spectacles,
which added to the simplicity of his appearance. A
graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, he had gone
into service as a private in Company F of the First Virginia
Regiment, and upon the promotion of Captain Lindsey
Walker, had been elected Captain of the Purcell Battery.</p>

<p>My time in Richmond passed almost too pleasantly. I
was not satisfied with myself, and saw no prospect of accomplishing
anything as long as I remained in the Navy.
McClellan’s army was close to Richmond, and one fine
morning, at the end of May, the battle of Seven Pines
began. I obtained leave of absence, and, armed with a
navy sword, hastened down to the field, arriving there
about night-fall. The first troops I fell in with at the front
belonged to a Georgia regiment, the Eighth Georgia, I
think; and I asked to be permitted to take a musket and
go in with them as a volunteer, the next morning. Next
morning came, but the fight did not, and I trudged disconsolately
back to Richmond.</p>

<p>I now made up my mind to leave the Navy. Fearing that
Captain Pegram would object to this, I went to the Navy Department
myself and handed in my resignation, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
been approved by Captain Parker. I took care to say that I
only resigned in order that I might go into the army as a
private soldier. My purpose was to join the Purcell Battery,
which Willie Pegram commanded, but he refused to
consent to this, telling me that if I waited something better
would turn up. I was not willing to wait, and went out to
the battery and reported to him for duty a few days before
the Seven Days Battle began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X.</a></h2>


<p>The camp of the Purcell Battery was then on the Mechanicsville
Turnpike, as well as I remember; and it was a
day or two after my arrival that the Confederate battle
flags were first distributed to the Army of Northern Virginia.
I remember, as though it were yesterday, the return
of Willie Pegram from head-quarters, with the battle flag
for our battery. It was only a square of coarse cloth with
a blue field and a red cross dotted with stars. But to the
soldiers of the Confederate armies it was then the emblem
of all that we fought for, as it is now the token of what the
Confederate soldiers endured, and of what our people lost.</p>

<p>At the time of the battles around Richmond the Artillery
had not been formed into battalions, as was done later in
the war; and to each brigade was attached one field-battery.
The Purcell Battery was attached to Field’s Brigade,
of A. P. Hill’s Division.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon of Thursday, June 26th, 1862, the
head of General Hill’s column crossed the Chickahominy,
and moved towards Mechanicsville. It was the first time I
had seen the Confederate troops marching to meet the
enemy; and the gleaming bayonets, and waving flags, the
rumbling of the artillery, and the steady tramp of the men,
were both exhilarating and imposing. One of Field’s regiments
led the advance, with two guns from our battery.
We neared a narrow road between two steep banks, and
were confident that we should feel the enemy there. There
was a puff of smoke and the sharp crack of a rifle; the skirmishers
advanced, and we threw some shells into the woods.
The skirmishers kept steadily forward. They entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
woods and were lost to sight. Soon they reached the
enemy’s line, and the engagement began. We had now
reached a point near Ellyson’s Mill, at Mechanicsville, which
had been strongly fortified by the enemy. They had a battery
in position, and amused themselves by taking pot-shots
at us. Willie Pegram, however, remained motionless in his
saddle, no more concerned at the shells which were ploughing
up the dust about him than if he had been lounging on
the porch in Franklin Street, this beautiful evening. An
officer rode hurriedly up, and then the order rang out:
“Attention, Battery! Forward! Trot! March!” and with
a cheer we rattled along the road and came into battery in
an open field, in full view of the enemy. The guns were
instantly loaded, and the firing began. The Yankees were
not idle; and a shower of shot and shell enveloped us. I
had not been assigned, as yet, to any particular duty in the
battery, and looked on as an interested observer until accident
should make a vacancy that I might fill. I tied my
horse behind a corn crib, near by, and awaited developments,
walking up and down in the rear of the guns to see what
was going on. It was not an agreeable situation, as there
was nothing to divert my attention from the manifold unpleasantnesses
of the terrific fire which the enemy concentrated
upon us. They had twenty-four guns in position
against our single battery, and were able to enfilade our
line, as well as to pound us by their direct fire. It was
one of the greatest errors of the early days of the Confederacy
that batteries were allowed to be knocked to pieces
in detail, when, by massing a dozen batteries, the enemy
could have been knocked quickly out of time and many
lives saved. A solid shot bowled past me, killed one of our
men, tore a leg and arm from another, and threw three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
horses into a bloody, struggling heap. This was my chance,
and I stepped to the gun and worked away as though existence
depended on my labors. For the great part of the
time I acted as Number 5, bringing the ammunition from
the limber to Number 2 at the piece. I felt for the first
time the fierce excitement of battle. There was no thought
of danger, though the men were falling rapidly on every side.</p>

<p>So the battle continued until about six o’clock, the men
cheering wildly whenever there was any sign of weakening
on the part of the enemy. I did not know what hurt me;
but I found myself on the ground, hearing, as I fell, a man
near me say: “That Britisher has gone up at last.” In a
few moments I recovered my senses, and found that I was
not dead, and that no bones appeared to be broken. The
warm blood was pouring down my left leg, and on examination
I saw that a piece of shell had scooped out five or
six inches of the flesh below the knee, and near the femoral
artery, making an ugly wound. I did not feel that I was
disabled, however, and, tying a handkerchief as tightly as I
could around my leg, I went back to my post, and there
remained until the battery was withdrawn after sunset.
Towards the end of the engagement only three men were
left at the gun at which I was serving. At a second gun
only four men were left. Another battery relieved us, and
drew some of the enemy’s fire. But I think it must have
been nine o’clock when we finally left the field. The official
list of casualties in our battery showed four killed and
forty-three wounded, out of about seventy-five who went
into the engagement. Among the killed was Lieutenant
Elphinstone.</p>

<p>The battle-field was several miles from Richmond, and
the problem was, how to get back there. I hobbled a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the way as well as I could, and was then put into an
ambulance with two wounded men, one of whom died
before we reached Richmond. I stopped at a Field Hospital
for a minute to get some morphine for my wounded
comrade, and then had my first experience of scientific
butchering. A rough table, consisting of two or three
planks, was used for the operations; and there the surgeons
were hard at work, their sleeves rolled up to the shoulders,
their arms and hands besmeared with blood, cutting deep
with their knives into the quivering flesh, or sawing with a
harsh grating sound through the bones of the insensible
soldier. Under the table lay arms, hands, feet, and legs,
thrown promiscuously in a heap, like the refuse of a slaughter
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI.</a></h2>


<p>Upon reaching Richmond I was taken to my old quarters
in Franklin Street, and made much of. The Richmond
<cite>Dispatch</cite>, after describing the battle in which we had been
engaged and giving a list of the casualties in our battery,
said: “This list proves the desperate bravery exhibited by
the command in the bloody strife. We learn that Mr.
Dawson, a young Englishman, who came over in the <i>Nashville</i>,
volunteered for the engagement, and received a wound
while acting most gallantly.” My old friends in the Navy
(and the Navy officers are more clannish and stick together
more closely than the Army officers do,) came at once to
see me. First, of course, was my dear friend, Captain R.
B. Pegram, who chided me for resigning from the Navy
without telling him what I was going to do. Commodore
Hollins, Commodore Forrest, and Captain Arthur Sinclair,
were exceedingly attentive. The surgeons told me there
was no danger of serious results from my wound, if severe
inflammation could be prevented; and Captain W. H. Murray,
of one of the Maryland regiments, rigged up an arrangement
for me by which water was allowed to drip, night and
day, on the bandages, to keep them moist and cool. Miss
Hetty Cary rather turned the tables on me, by sending me
word that she would have come down to my room with her
sister to see me, but that I had criticised so sharply, before
I had been hit, the conduct of ladies who had gone to the
hospitals to attend to the wounded soldiers, that she would
not think of doing violence to my feelings now by giving
me any of her personal attention. In truth, the young
ladies who did visit hospitals were disposed to be rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
partial in their attentions. There were pet patients wherever
the young ladies were allowed to go. A very good illustration
is given in a paragraph which went the rounds of the
Southern papers, as showing the experience of an interesting
wounded soldier, who had dark eyes and a darling mustache,
and a generally romantic aspect. A young lady said
to him: “Is there not anything that I can do for you?”
Wearily the soldier said: “Nothing, I thank you.” Not
to be baffled, the young lady said: “Do let me do something
for you. Will you let me wash your face for you?”
The sad response of the soldier was: “Well, if you want to
right bad, I reckon you must; but that will make seven
times that my face has been washed this evening.” There
were some patriotic verses on the same subject, written in
all seriousness, which ended with this touching couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">“And every day there is a rush</p>
<p class="verse0">To give the soldiers milk and mush.”</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The doctors complained, too, that the young ladies were
rather in their way; and that their prescriptions were oftentimes
set at nought by surreptitious doses of pies and sweetmeats.
But the motive was always good and pure, and,
after I had known what it was to be hit myself and to need
a woman’s attentions, I was not disposed to quarrel with
any one, however fascinating, for being assiduous in attentions
to a wounded Confederate.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able to stand up, Captain Murray offered
to go with me to Petersburg, where I might remain until
I recovered. Mrs. Annie T. White invited me to stay at her
house, and I was there for several weeks. While there, Mr.
John Dunlop, who has been one of the staunchest friends
I have had, called to see me. He was a native of Petersburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but was educated in England, and took the degree of
A. M. at Wadham College, Oxford, not long before the
beginning of the war. He went to New York to practice
law there; but returned to Virginia as soon as the State
seceded, and joined one of the Virginia regiments as a
private. He was appointed aide-de-camp to General Armistead,
which was the position he held at the time that I
first knew him. After the second battle of Manassas he
was retired on account of his failing sight, and went to
England. After the war he returned to Virginia, and is
now living at Richmond, where he pursues his profession
with much success.</p>

<p>Murray returned to Richmond in a day or two. Poor
fellow! I never saw him again. He was killed at Gettysburg.
I have fancied that he was deeply attached to Miss
Jennie Cary, who has never married.</p>

<p>Mr. Raines was greatly concerned at hearing that I had
been wounded, and sent his carriage to Petersburg to take
me down to his house in Sussex. He told me that his
house must be my home. In his own simple and heartfelt
language: “My dollars and cents I will divide with you;
and half my bread and meat is yours.”</p>

<p>As soon as I was able, I went from Petersburg to Sussex,
and there remained until I had recovered completely. It
was here, at Oakland, as the plantation of Mr. Raines was
named, that I learned what Southern life really was. I
was treated in every respect as one of the family, and was
hailed by the darkies, big and little, as part of the establishment.
They did, however, have a rather unpleasant
way of prognosticating an untimely end for me, as I heard
the little negroes chanting continually: “Poor Mas’r Frank!
he bin sure to die long before de acorn come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Robert B. Pegram was staying at the place of
Major Belsches, about two miles away, and one morning Nat.
Raines, Jr., and I drove over to make him a visit. As we
passed by the mill, about half way, we met Captain Pegram
in a buggy, and saw that his benignant face was shining
even more brightly than usual. His first words were:
“Dawson, I have some good news for you.” I asked him
what it was, and he handed me a note from his cousin, Mrs.
G. W. Randolph, the wife of the Secretary of War. The
words were few, but they were pregnant words for me.
They were these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent smcap">“Dear Cousin Robert:</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph has ordered a commission as First Lieutenant of Artillery to
be made out for Mr. Dawson.</p>

<p class="right padr6">Yours, sincerely,</p>
<p class="right">MARY RANDOLPH.”</p></div>

<p>The cup of my happiness was full. Standing in the
streets in Richmond, and watching the troops as they
passed, I had so often wondered whether, in the course of
time, I might hold a commission in the Confederate army;
and now it had come to me unexpectedly, unsolicited, undeserved.
I learned afterwards that Willie Pegram had been
so good as to recommend my appointment on account of
my behavior at Mechanicsville; and his recommendation
was vigorously sustained by his uncle, Captain Robert B.
Pegram, and my Navy friends. The Confederate government
had no power to appoint company officers for the
volunteer forces; and for this reason I did not receive a
commission in the line. My appointment was under an
Act of the Confederate Congress, which authorized the
appointment of forty First Lieutenants of Artillery for
assignment to duty as Ordnance officers.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII.</a></h2>


<p>There was joy indeed at Oakland when the news of my
promotion was received there; and the young ladies set
themselves to work at once to contrive ways and means
whereby my gray Navy coat could be converted into the
tunic of an Artillery officer. The most troublesome part
of it all, we found, was to get the Austrian knot on the
arm, the “curleyqueue,” as we called it, into the right
shape. It is so long since, and these things are so soon
forgotten, that it may not be out of place to mention here
that my new uniform was a gray tunic with scarlet cuffs
and scarlet collar; an Austrian knot of gold braid on each
arm; two bars of gold lace, denoting the rank, on each side
of the standing collar; gray trousers with broad red stripes;
a scarlet kepi, trimmed with gold braid, and commonly
known, by the way, as the “woodpecker cap.”</p>

<p>One important consideration for me about this time was,
how I should get the money to pay for a horse and other
necessary equipments. Mr. Raines had two sons in the
service, and was, as I knew, supporting the families of several
soldiers from the neighborhood. He came to me, however,
and told me that he had instructed his factors at
Petersburg, to honor any drafts that I might make upon
them; and that I must go there and get the money necessary
for a horse, and anything else that I wanted. This
was more than I was willing to accept; but I had not
much choice in the matter; and Mr. Raines assured me
that it was a pleasure to him to be able to assist me in
preparing myself to fill properly the position that I had
won. So off I went to Petersburg, and thence to Richmond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in all the brilliancy of gray and scarlet and gold;
the little darkies on the plantation, as I drove off from
Oakland, singing the refrain that I have mentioned before.</p>

<p>I had not yet been assigned to duty with any particular
command, and had not the remotest idea of what kind of
duty it was to be; but I had heard a good deal of General
Longstreet, and when I reached Richmond, I went to the
Ordnance Bureau to have a preparatory talk with Colonel
Gorgas, who was Chief of Ordnance of the army. I began
to realize, from what I saw around me, that I was likely to
be in a worse plight as an Ordnance officer, whatever that
might be, than I was as an able bodied seaman, so-called,
on the <i>Nashville</i>; and I said frankly to Colonel Gorgas,
that I felt inclined to decline the commission which had
been tendered me. He asked me why I intended to take
such a step. I said that I knew nothing whatever of the
duties of an Ordnance officer, and hardly knew the difference
between a Napoleon gun and a Belgian rifle. I did
not think it right, therefore, to undertake what I did not
think I would be able to perform satisfactorily. Colonel
Gorgas looked at me a moment to see whether I was in
earnest or not, and then said very quietly: “I think you had
better accept the commission; I reckon you know as much
about it as many other officers who have been assigned to
the same duty.” I took him at his word, and asked to be
assigned to General Longstreet’s corps. At the same time
I mentioned to Colonel Gorgas that I did not want any
duty in the rear; and he gave me a letter to General
Longstreet, requesting that, if any particularly hazardous
service should fall within the line of my duty, it might be
given to me.</p>

<p>It was difficult to get such a horse as I wanted in Richmond;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
but I succeeded in getting a respectable iron sabre
with a painted scabbard, and I bought a good revolver and
an imitation McClellan saddle. With these, and a large
valise as my baggage, I went down to the Virginia Central
Railroad station to take the train for Culpepper C. H.,
which was the nearest point on the railroad to the place
where the army was believed to be. I should mention that,
after the battles around Richmond, Jackson had attacked
and defeated the enemy at Cedar Mountain; and the
whole army of Northern Virginia was now in motion towards
Manassas. I met, at the station, Captain Taylor, of
Norfolk, a naval officer, who had been appointed Captain
of artillery, and assigned to duty with Stephen D. Lee’s
battalion of reserve artillery. We traveled together, and
left the cars at Culpepper C. H. By dint of hard talking,
we obtained quarters for the night at the hotel, and the
next morning we set out to overtake the army. I left my
valise with the hotel-keeper; but I could not consent to
part with my saddle, which I lugged along as best I could.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII.</a></h2>


<p>The roads were sandy and the day was intensely hot, and
the weight of the saddle increased every mile. Soon we
struck a column of troops marching in the same direction
as ourselves, and the men began the usual chaff. “I say,
Mister,” said one, “who stole your horse?” Another, in
an expostulatory tone of voice, rejoined: “Why don’t you
let him alone; don’t you see that the other man is going to
get up and ride?” Then again: “Come out of that saddle;
it’s no use to say you ain’t there; I can see your legs sticking
out.” One man very demurely stepped up to Captain
Taylor, and said: “You must not mind these boys, sir;
they don’t mean any harm by it.” He replied very courteously:
“I don’t mind it all, my friend.” “Well,” continued
the man, “they don’t mean any harm, but they always
carry on in that way whenever they see a d&mdash;d fool come
along.” This last sally caused a shout all along the line;
and we were glad enough to part company with them.</p>

<p>That night we met with some of Captain Taylor’s friends,
who gave us supper; after which we had a bath in a creek
near by, and, rolled up in our blankets, had an excellent
sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning we were on the road betimes; and I managed
to stow away my saddle in a wagon. There were all
manner of rumors concerning the whereabouts of Longstreet,
and we kept on until we reached the little village of Stevensburg.
No positive information could be obtained
here; but we found a man who was willing to let us have
dinner. We enjoyed the meal thoroughly, chatting merrily
the while. Two or three citizens came into the room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
scrutinized us closely, but we paid no attention to them.
Presently, after whispering among themselves, one of them
approached me and said: “What battery do you belong to,
sir?” “None at all,” I replied; and went on with my dinner.
Shortly he returned, and said: “What State do you
hail from, sir?” “None at all,” I replied, “except a state
of semi-starvation.” This seemed to annoy him, and he
tried me once more: “Where are you going to?” “To
General Longstreet’s head-quarters,” I answered. “What
for, sir?” questioned the stranger. In the meanwhile I had
finished my dinner, and feeling very comfortable, I turned
to Captain Taylor and said: “I have heard a great deal of
the curiosity of Americans, and I am disposed to gratify it
as far as I can conveniently; but this man is becoming a
bore.” The inquiring citizens now took a new turn, and
asked Captain Taylor where he was going to. Whereupon
he told them that it was none of their business. We paid
our bill, and got up to leave the room, when one of the
citizens quietly closed the door, and said: “Men, you can’t
leave here until you show your papers!” “The devil we
can’t!” said I. “What right have you to ask for our
papers?” The answer came sharply enough: “We ask for
your papers by the right that every true citizen has to question
men whom he suspects to be deserters or worse.” Both
Captain Taylor and I were rather high tempered. I had a
great idea of my own dignity as a Confederate officer, and
I told our inquiring friends at once that we positively
refused to show any papers or answer any more questions.
They told us that they would not allow us to depart until
we did. Captain Taylor drew his pistol, and I drew my
Confederate-iron sabre, and a lively fight of two to four
was imminent. At this moment there was a violent knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
at the door, and a cavalry officer with two or three dismounted
cavalrymen, came in. The citizens took him out
and talked with him; and when they returned the officer
asked us where we wanted to go to. Captain Taylor said
he wanted to find General Lee’s head-quarters; and that I
wanted to find General Longstreet. The officer told us
very demurely that he was going along in the right direction,
and if we would accompany him he would show us the
road. We thought that we now had the best of the bargain;
and the citizens who had so tormented us smiled
grimly as we rode off. After riding for some distance without
anything being said, I asked our escort whether we were
nearing the place to which we were going, and he replied
in the affirmative. Passing through a thick skirt of woods,
he suddenly wheeled to the right, and ordered us to follow
him. We did so; and a few paces further on we saw the
body of a man dangling from the bough of a tree; a halter
having been used instead of a rope, to swing the poor devil
up by. Asking what this meant, I was told that the dead
man was a spy, and that all spies were treated in that way
in this army. I was glad to receive the information, but
did not see that it had any personal application until we
reached a tent in front of which a stern looking man, in a
General’s uniform, was lolling on the ground. The officer
dismounted, saluted, and said: “General, here are two men
who have been arrested by some citizens of Stevensburg
on suspicion of being spies.” “Ah, indeed,” said the General,
rising with some interest. “What proofs have you of
this?” “No particular proofs, General; but they refuse to
show any papers, or to give any account of themselves.”
“Well!” said the General, “that’s the best proof in the
world. I have a short way of dealing with these rascals.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Then turning to a courier who was standing by, he said:
“Tell Captain &mdash;&mdash; to detail a non-commissioned officer
and three men to report to me immediately.” Turning to
us he kindly said: “Fine morning! men. Any message or
any other little thing that you would like to send to your
friends in the North?” Captain Taylor and I had been so
completely taken aback that, up to this time, we had said
nothing; but the joke was becoming rather serious, and I
said frankly that Captain Taylor and I had refused to show
our papers because they had been asked for impertinently,
and without any authority; but that we had in our pockets
our orders and our passports, and that I had letters of introduction
to General Longstreet from General Randolph and
Colonel Gorgas. The order for the detail was countermanded
as soon as our papers had been glanced at; but
our friend, the General, told us that it was a suspicious circumstance,
as we must admit, to find two officers of artillery
wandering about the country without any command, and on
foot. I suspect the nautical bearing of Captain Taylor,
which his uniform did not disguise, and my own fresh color
and English accent, had more to do with our trouble than
the fact that we were dismounted and alone. I really had
some little difficulty in making myself understood at Stevensburg.
When I asked for water at the house, the man
hesitated until I had repeated the word two or three times;
and then asked if I meant “wat-ter.” We started off again,
and I parted from Captain Taylor, who went to General
Lee’s head-quarters, while I plodded along to Brandy Station.
I had seen Captain Taylor for the last time. He was
killed in action soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Almost broken down, I was trudging wearily along the
road when I heard some one bawling out my name. Looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
around I found that it was Lieutenant McGraw, of the
Purcell Battery. In a minute or two I was in comfort and
at ease in the midst of my old comrades. I had not seen
Captain Willie Pegram since the fight at Mechanicsville,
and we had a great deal of news to tell each other. The
battery was parked in the woods, and, although we had no
supper, I slept without waking. In the morning there was
an artillery duel with the enemy at the Rappahannock
River, in which we lost one or two men. Willie Pegram
then lent me a poor old rip of a horse, with a hole in his
side, punched there at Gaines’ Mill by a piece of a shell;
and I sallied forth once more to find General Longstreet.
By this time I was about half starved, and I was very much
disgusted by a soldier whom I met at the roadside with a
huge pile of corn-dodgers, and who refused to sell me a piece
of bread, although I offered him $5 for it. But I found
General Longstreet at last, and was introduced by him to
his Chief Ordnance Officer, Colonel Peyton L. Manning, who
directed me to return to Brandy Station, where I should
find the Ordnance train of the corps.</p>

<p>About night I found the train, and met with a cordial
reception at the hands of Lieutenants Leech and Duxberry.
A good supper of coffee, biscuit, and fried bacon was
improvised, and I heartily enjoyed the quiet luxury of a
pipe.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV.</a></h2>


<p>A day or two after my arrival at my post, I succeeded in
buying a very good riding horse, and hired a capable servant.
I may as well say just here that I found Colonel Manning,
my immediate superior, an exceedingly easy man to get
along with. Unquestionably a gentleman in his tastes and
habits, and brave as a lion, he knew comparatively little of
his work as Ordnance officer, and was unable to write an
ordinary official letter correctly. Spelling was indeed his
weakest point. He was from Aberdeen, Miss., and died at
his home there three or four years after the surrender.
Lieutenant Leech was from Charlottesville, Va., and was
very quiet and unassuming. Lieutenant Duxberry was good
tempered, but exceedingly conceited, and casting about
always to make himself friends at head-quarters. One of
his peculiar conceits was that his name, Duxberry, was a corruption
of Duc de Berri, from whom he supposed himself to
be in some extraordinary way descended. I found out
afterwards that, at the beginning of the war, he was an
assistant in a drug store at Montgomery, Ala., and that he
was born somewhere in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Longstreet pressed through Thoroughfare Gap and reached
Manassas just in time to save Jackson from being overwhelmed
there. I knew but little of what was going
on, and did not see much of the great battle itself. Here I
made my first capture in the shape of a Gatling gun which
had been abandoned by the enemy, and what was of more
importance, I secured a commissary wagon containing a
barrel of ground coffee.</p>

<p>The army now advanced to the Potomac, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
crossed at Point of Rocks; the bands playing “Maryland,
my Maryland!” There was no cause to complain any
longer of a lack of provisions, and we were able to buy
whatever we wanted with Confederate money at fair prices.
After resting a day or two at Hagerstown, where we completed
the equipment of our mess, we moved rapidly to
South Mountain, where we had a brisk fight, and were
driven back. This was on August 15th, I think. Late at
night I rode back to the camp to get some supper, but had
hardly told the cook to make the necessary preparations
when an order came from General Longstreet to me to take
charge of the Ordnance trains of the corps, and move them
to Williamsport. The order was imperative, and I was
directed to move as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock at night I started. It was intensely
dark and the roads were rough. Towards morning I
entered the Hagerstown and Williamsport Turnpike, where
I found a cavalry picket. The officer in charge asked me
to move the column as quickly as I could, and to keep the
trains well closed up. I asked him if the enemy were on
the road, and he told me that it was entirely clear, and that
he had pickets out in every direction. It was only a few
miles now to Williamsport, and I could see the camp-fires
of our troops across the river. I was hungry, sleepy and
tired, and the prospect of camp and supper in an hour
seemed the summit of bliss. I was forty or fifty yards
ahead of the column, when a voice from the roadside called
out “halt!” The gloss was not yet off my uniform, and I
could not suppose that such a command, shotted with a big
oath, was intended for me. In a moment it was repeated.
I quickly rode to the side of the road in the direction of
the voice, and found myself at the entrance of a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lane, and there adown it were horses and men in a line that
stretched out far beyond my vision. To the trooper who
was nearest to me I said indignantly: “How dare you
halt an officer in this manner.” The reply was to the point:
“Surrender, and dismount! You are my prisoner!” Almost
before the words were uttered I was surrounded, and found
that I had ridden right into the midst of a body of Yankee
cavalry, numbering about two thousand, who had escaped
from Harper’s Ferry that night to avoid the surrender which
was to take place in the morning. I was placed under guard
on the roadside, and as the trains came up they were halted,
and the men who were with them were quietly captured.
In a short time the column moved off in the direction of
the Pennsylvania line. I was allowed to ride my own horse.
By the side of each team a Federal soldier rode, and, by dint
of cursing the negro drivers and beating the mules with
their swords, the cavalrymen contrived to get the jaded
animals along at a gallop. While we were halted, one of
my Sergeants had knocked the linchpins out of the wheels
of the leading wagons, in the hope that this would delay the
march. The wheels came off and the wagons were upset,
but a squad of men dismounted instantly, threw the wagons
out of the road, and set fire to them, so that there was no
halt of consequence. I had a cavalryman on each side of
me, and tried vainly to get an opportunity to slip off into
the woods.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV.</a></h2>


<p>Soon after daylight we reached the little village of Greencastle,
Pennsylvania, where the citizens came out to look
at the “Rebel” prisoners. They hurrahed for their own
men and cursed at us. Even the women joined in the game.
Several of them brought their children to the roadside
and told them to shake their fists at the “d&mdash;d Rebels.”
Still there were some kind people in Greencastle. Three
or four ladies came to us, and, without pretending to have
any liking for Confederates, showed their charitable disposition
by giving us some bread and a cup of cold water. My
horse was taken from me at Greencastle and ridden off by
a dirty-looking cavalryman. Then the Confederates, numbering
a hundred or more, were packed into the cars, and
sent by the railway to Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Duxberry had the good luck to be away from camp the
night that we marched from Crampton’s Gap, and was not
taken. Leech had been asleep in one of the wagons, and
did not wake up until we had all been gathered in.</p>

<p>Chambersburg is a pretty little town, and I had the satisfaction
of seeing it a year later under pleasanter auspices.
On arriving there the first time, the Confederates were put
in the open yard of the jail which we pretty well filled.
Our presence there suggested a new and interesting game
to the small boys of Chambersburg. It was a plain calculation
that a stone which should fall within the area of the
yard would be very apt to hit one of the prisoners. The
boys, therefore, amused themselves by pitching stones over
from the outside, enjoying in this way the luxury of scaring
the “Rebels,” and hurting them too, without any risk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
themselves. It was sport to the boys, but it came near
being death to some of our men. But here, as at Greencastle,
there were some charitable souls. Mr. A. K.
McClure, who is now the editor of the Philadelphia <cite>Times</cite>,
came to the jail with a committee of citizens, and gave us
an abundance of coffee and bread and meat. That night
we lay on the rough stones in the jail yard, and in the morning
we were put on the train for Harrisburg. We did not go
into the town, but were taken at once to Camp Curtin, in
the suburbs, where we were to remain until our final destination
should be determined on.</p>

<p>By this time I had no baggage. It had been promised
that my valise, which was in one of the wagons, should be
given to me, but it was appropriated, I suppose, by one of
our captors. At all events, I saw nothing of it, and could
get no information about it.</p>

<p>At Camp Curtin we were tolerably comfortable. There
were only two officers in our party besides myself, and as
my uniform was comparatively bright and fresh I attracted
more attention than my rank warranted. The United States
officers at the camp were exceedingly attentive, and talked
with me in the frankest manner about the position of affairs
and the prospects of their army. They gave me a blanket
which I needed sorely, and bestowed upon me what was
equally desirable, a new tooth-brush. The evening after
my arrival, the Commandant of the camp asked me whether
I would not like to go into town, saying that one of the
officers was anxious to take me in with him. I told him
I had no other dress than my uniform, and if I had I would
not wear it, and I did not suppose that any of the officers
would care to go into Harrisburg with a Confederate officer
in uniform. The Commandant said that this was what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
proposed, although he did not think it very prudent. The
Commandant gave me the necessary pass, and Captain &mdash;&mdash; and
I went into the town.</p>

<p>First we went into the principal hotel and took supper.
The persons hanging about the hotel looked at me rather
sulkily, but I was too hungry to pay much attention to
them. After supper we walked out to the front of the
hotel, where my companion slapped me on the shoulder,
and said in a loud voice: “Here is a real live Rebel officer!
The first man that says a word to him I will knock his d&mdash;d
head off!” This was not a very pacific speech to make to
a crowd of fanatical Pennsylvanians, who had just heard
that the battle of Sharpsburg had begun. Nothing came of
it at the moment, and my companion now insisted that we
should visit the principal music hall. As we entered, the
whole company of singers was on the stage shouting lustily:
“The Union and McClellan forever! Three cheers for the
Buck-tail Brigade,” the audience joining in the chorus with
patriotic energy. My companion marched me down the
middle of the hall to the very front seat, and there was
a murmur of astonishment and disapprobation. But my
companion did not mind it, and I could not help it, so we
remained there about half an hour and then passed out,
with no other damage than being scowled at by the audience.
By this time my companion was decidedly exhilarated; and
the next time that he invited an attack, by saying that he
would inflict condign punishment on any one who molested
me, an indignant patriot knocked my hat off. I knocked
down the man who did it, and half a dozen men pitched
into me at once. There was a general scrimmage. Knives
were drawn, a shot was fired, and I knew nothing more until
I found myself in a large room surrounded by a group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
soldiers. In the row, it seemed, my companion had been
treated rather badly, and I had been choked and knocked
until I was insensible, and, indeed, was only saved from
death by a woman, who seized the arm of my foremost assailant
and prevented him from stabbing me to the heart.
Just as I had learned the particulars, the door opened and
an officer came in whom I recognized as the Commandant
of Camp Curtin. He said very quietly: “I thought you
would be very apt to bring up at the guard-house about
this time, so I came in to look after you.” He then accompanied
me back to camp. I did not wish to trouble the
Commandant to escort me to my quarters, but he told me
that his guards were quite young, rather stupid, and very
malicious, and quite apt to shoot at a stray prisoner without
giving him a chance to halt and explain. I objected no
further. The whole night’s work was a very unpleasant
one for me, but I had no way of escaping from the difficulty
when I once reached the city. Captain &mdash;&mdash; had been
drinking hard, which I had not suspected until it was too
late. If I had left him and gone off alone I should have
been in worse case than by remaining in his company.</p>

<p>The next morning the Harrisburg paper had a glowing
account of an attempt I had made to escape from camp,
and said that, when recaptured, I had nearly succeeded in
laying a mine to blow up the great bridge across the Susquehannah.
The newspapers, too, were very severe in their
condemnation of the Union officers who had been seen in
the city in company with a “Rebel officer in full uniform.”</p>

<p>Early the next day we were ordered to be ready to take
the cars for Philadelphia, on the way to Fort Delaware. Just
before leaving camp, I was told that there were some ladies
at the gate who desired to see me. I went down and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
two handsomely dressed women in an open carriage. One
of them asked me whether I did not recognize her. I told
her that I did not, and she said: “You ought to do so, for
I was passing by when you got into that difficulty in town,
and was the means of saving your life.” I thanked her very
warmly, but told her that there were too many demands on
my attention at the time of the fight to permit me to have
seen her. The ladies bade me very heartily good-bye, and
I left my unknown friends.</p>

<p>It was not a long run to Philadelphia, and in the cars was
a civilian who accosted me courteously, and asked me many
questions about the Confederacy and the Southern people,
the character of the army and the estimation in which the
different Generals were held. All such questions I answered
as well as I could without divulging anything that might
be of injury to our side, and taking care to depict everything
in the highest possible colors. It was night when the train
reached the Quaker City, and I suppose that ten thousand
persons were awaiting the arrival of the train. There were
no lamps in the cars, and the persons in the crowd outside
clambered up at the windows, even lighting matches and
holding lanterns to our heads that they might see us the
better, as though we were wild beasts in a cage. One man
thrust his hand in through the sash, grasped my hand firmly
and whispered: “Cheer up, it will all come out right.” At
last, it was my turn to leave the cars, and, as usual, my
scarlet cap attracted more attention than was agreeable.
Some said I was a drummer-boy, others declared I was a
Colonel, while one big fellow shouted out that he knew that
I was a spy who had deserted from the Union Army, and
had been recaptured. There was instantly a shout: “Hang
him to the lamp-post,” and for a few minutes I was in worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
plight at Philadelphia than I had been in at Stevensburg.
The guard, however, succeeded in driving the crowd back,
and I reached in safety the steamer which was to take us
to Fort Delaware.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Late at night we reached the Island upon which Fort
Delaware is built. We were marched up to the gates, and
were halted there until an officer had passed along the line
and enquired whether any of the prisoners wished to take
the oath of allegiance to the United States government.
There was no reply, and we were marched into the Barracks.
These Barracks were common wooden sheds, affording accommodation
for about ten thousand persons. The bunks
were arranged in tiers of three, and into one of these I
crawled. The next morning I was told that these Barracks
were the quarters for the privates and non-commissioned
officers, and that, by requesting it, I could be removed to
the quarters for the officers, which were inside the Fort.
Lieutenant Leech and I wrote to the Commandant, and
were at once removed to the Fort, where we were installed
in a large barrack-room, which then contained seventy or
eighty officers. The highest in rank was a Major Holliday,
belonging to one of the Virginia regiments.</p>

<p>During the time that I was in the Fort I slept next to
Adjutant W. P. DuBose, of the Holcombe Legion, who had
been taken prisoner at South Mountain. He was supposed
to have been killed, but had really been but slightly wounded.
When he returned to South Carolina he found that his
obituary had been published, and that his friends were in
mourning for him. Afterwards he went into the ministry,
and was appointed Chaplain of Kershaw’s Brigade. He is
now one of the Professors of the University of the South,
at Sewanee.</p>

<p>As the number of officers increased with new arrivals, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
room became painfully crowded. Within the room we could
do pretty much as we pleased, except that we were not
allowed to gather together in a body, lest we might plan
an escape, I suppose. Nor were we allowed to cross the
threshold of the door, on pain of being shot. The guards
were abusive, and would swear at us like dogs if we did
anything they disapproved of. A word in reply was met
by a blow with the butt end of a musket, or by an order
that the offender be sent to the Black Hole. Still we were
far better off than our comrades were in the Barracks outside.
Our room was dry, warm and well lighted, while the
Barracks were cold, damp and dark. Our room had conveniences
for washing to a certain extent, and there was plenty
of water of a poor quality. The washing of clothes went on
all the time, which was not conducive to the comfort of
those who used the washstand for personal ablutions. The
inhabitants of the garments which were steeped in the washstand
naturally took refuge in the water.</p>

<p>No exercise of any kind was permitted to us, and we only
left the room to march down into the mess-hall. For breakfast
we had a cup of poor coffee without milk or sugar, and
two small pieces of bad bread. For dinner we had a cup of
greasy water misnamed soup, a piece of beef two inches
square and a half inch thick, and two slices of bread. At
supper the fare was the same as at breakfast. This was exceedingly
light diet. Some of the officers behaved disagreeably;
and eight or ten of us, principally Virginians, associated
ourselves together for mutual protection, and formed
a mess of our own. We contrived to make some additions
to our diet by purchases at the Sutler’s store. When we
had no money the Sutler would take watches or other valuables
in pledge, and let us have the provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of the citizens of Baltimore, including Mr. Carpenter,
had been arrested for disloyalty, and they were found
at this time in the Fort. They were not watched as closely
as we were, and sometimes in going down to dinner we had
an opportunity to exchange a word with them. They were
jolly fellows, and exceedingly liberal. Mr. Carpenter was
editor of the Maryland <cite>News Sheet</cite>, and was released about
the time of our arrival. Being appointed the chairman of the
Baltimore Society for the relief of prisoners, he returned to
the Fort to see what our wants were. At one shipment
over two thousand pair of excellent shoes were sent to the
Fort for the prisoners. Indeed, each one of the three thousand
Confederates in the Fort received a blanket, a pair of
shoes, warm trousers, a jacket, and a felt hat; or such of
these things as he required. Nor were the officers in our
room forgotten. Clothing of every kind was sent to us. It
was proposed at first that the senior officer present should
take charge of the supplies, and distribute the clothing according
to the necessities of the individuals. This did not
suit some of our comrades. When the packages were
brought in and opened there was a general rush, and those
who pulled hardest and pushed most got the larger part of
the spoils. I saw men wear two pair of new trousers under
an old pair, and then complain to Mr. Carpenter that they
wanted a new pair. And so it was with jackets and with
under-clothing. Blankets were in great demand. One man
who was crying lustily for a blanket was found to have four
new blankets hidden under his bunk.</p>

<p>I had only been in the Fort a day or two when the guard
called my name, and handed me a newspaper. This was a
most unusual occurrence, as newspapers were not allowed
to be given to us, unless they contained some startling report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of Union victories. The newspaper was the Philadelphia
<cite>Inquirer</cite>, a rabid Union sheet, and I was curious to
see what it contained that concerned me. There I saw, in
big type, the announcement of “The Arrival of the Rebel
Prisoners!” “Conversation with a Rebel Officer of Longstreet’s
Staff!” “Condition of the South!” “What is
thought of the Rebel Generals!” &amp;c., &amp;c. The writer said
that, in the cars, he had had the pleasure of a conversation
with Lieutenant Dawson, of General Longstreet’s Staff, who
was in England when the war began, but immediately returned
to his home in Sussex County, Va., and entered the
Confederate service! After complimenting me upon my
intelligence and courtesy, he gave a very fair report of what
I said. The mystery was explained. My inquisitive friend
on the cars was a newspaper reporter. I was annoyed by
the publicity given to what I had said, for I feared that my
friends at the South would misunderstand it; but it proved
after all to be a fortunate occurrence for me. Two days
after the appearance of the article in the Philadelphia <cite>Inquirer</cite>,
the guard came and began to talk to me in a surprisingly
civil way. Suddenly he turned his back to me and
slipped a letter into my hand, telling me not to let any one
see it. I hurried off to the only private place we had, and
read my letter. It was from a Mr. Neal, of Walnut Street,
Philadelphia. He said that he had seen my name in the
<cite>Inquirer</cite>, and that, being a Virginian and a prisoner, I had
claims upon him; and that anything that I wanted, either
in money or clothes, he would be only too happy to send
me. I replied, thanking him for his kindness, and asking
that he would send me some under-clothing, of which I
stood in great need. Mr. Neal at once came down to the
Fort, and brought me a valise well furnished with handkerchiefs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
socks, shirts, collars, and other things that I required.
He also insisted that I should take a small sum of money,
which I was fortunately able to return to him when I was
set at liberty. Much to my regret, I have not been able to
learn anything about Mr. Neal since the war ended.</p>

<p>I had hardly settled down to the quiet enjoyment of my
valise and its contents, when a big basket was brought to
me, with a note from a Miss Spotswood, who said she saw
by the papers that I was from Sussex, Virginia, where she
had spent many happy years, and begged that in memory
of this I would accept the accompanying basket. I did.
In the basket were jelly, preserves, sugar, tea, coffee, pickles,
pepper and salt, a comb and brush, a tooth-brush, note paper,
envelopes and postage stamps. My comfort was now
complete. Who but a woman would have thought of sending
so many little necessaries which I could not otherwise
have obtained!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII.</a></h2>


<p>The time dragged heavily, although we amused ourselves
by singing Southern songs and playing games, some very
pretty chess-men and chequers having been made by the
prisoners. There were cards in abundance, and there was a
faro-bank; but these games were not patronized by our
mess. Once on a Sunday we were allowed to go to Church
service on the ramparts, but this privilege was not granted
again.</p>

<p>The confinement had a serious effect upon me, and I became
really unwell; but new courage was given to all of us
by the rumor that there would soon be a general exchange
of prisoners, and that we should be released on parole. The
rumor gained ground; but day after day passed and no confirmation
came. When we had almost given up hope, an
Orderly announced to us that Major Burton, the Commandant,
had sent a message to us, which he would deliver if
we would receive it quietly. In a moment all was still:
“Major Burton says that orders have been received from
Washington to send you all on to Virginia to be exchanged,
as soon as boats can be secured.” We could not restrain
the cheers that rose to our lips.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards, when we began to think that
we had been deceived, the printed forms of parole were
brought in for signature. This part of the performance
having been completed, Major Holliday, the senior officer,
was called for, and went out. Shortly afterwards one of
the Captains was taken away; then another Captain was
sent for. When five or six had gone out and none had
returned, so that all the tracks went one way, we began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wonder what it meant. My name was next called. I went
out, and was conducted to Major Burton’s office, where was
an officer in full uniform. Major Burton said that Colonel
&mdash;&mdash;, of the United States Army, wished to speak with
me. The Colonel asked me whether I was on General
Longstreet’s staff. I told him I was. He then asked me
how many divisions there were on General Longstreet’s
command. I did not answer him. He repeated the question,
and asked how many men Longstreet had. My reply
was: “You have no right to ask such questions; and you
cannot suppose that I shall so far forget my duty as an
officer, and my honor as a gentleman, as to tell you anything
whatever concerning the command to which I belong.”
Again being asked the question with the same result, I
was given up as a bad job, and told that I could return to
my quarters. Hurrying back to the room, taking on the
way a bag of cakes that some sweet Maryland girls offered
me, I reached the room and found the men there in great
excitement, as no one of those who had been called out had
come back. I described what was going on, and bade them
be on their guard. By this time it had been ascertained
that I had returned to our quarters instead of retiring to
the room where were placed the other officers who had been
catechized. So I was hurried out again, and unceremoniously
put in the pen. The object was to keep the officers
in our quarters in ignorance of what was expected to be extracted
from them. But the hint I had had time to give
was sufficient. Thenceforward the haughty Colonel received
free answers to his questions; but I am not disposed to
think that the information was very valuable. He asked
particularly the number of Maryland troops in our service,
and one officer told him that we now had fifty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Maryland Infantry, ten thousand Cavalry, and five battalions
of Artillery. The interrogator was astonished. He
said he had thought that there were only one or two thousand
Maryland troops in our service, which was near the
truth. The officer told him that of late all the Marylanders
in the different Brigades had been consolidated into a Maryland
Corps, which had the strength stated. A special note
was taken of this information. Another officer belonged to
a Brigade which had about four hundred muskets, and was
asked the strength of it. He asked whether his interrogator
wanted to know its present strength or the usual
strength. The Colonel said he wanted to know both.
The officer told him that the usual strength was about
twenty-two hundred men, but he reckoned it had not more
than eighteen hundred men now.</p>

<p>At last the long expected steamers came, and we went
aboard. Our confinement was at an end, and only the sea
trip and the run up the James River lay before us. The
Sutler tried hard to play a Yankee trick. I have mentioned
that we pawned watches and chains with him in order to buy
provisions. Prior to the time for leaving the Fort most of
us had obtained the money to redeem them. Major Burton
indeed offered to furnish us any small sum that we needed,
which we might remit to him when we reached home. But
the Sutler, as soon as he learned that we were going away,
went up to Philadelphia, and did not return. It was evident
that he intended to remain absent until we were out
of reach; but the boats were later in arriving than he expected,
and he was obliged to come back to his post. Our
pledges were redeemed, and the Sutler received a severe
rebuke from Major Burton. No one could have been more
considerate, consistently with his duty, than Major Burton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was. This is the same noble officer who had President
Davis in charge, after he was taken from the custody of the
brutal officer who caused him to be so tortured at Fortress
Monroe, as described in Dr. Craven’s well known book.
Mrs. Burton was, I think, a Mexican lady, and sympathized
very deeply with the Southerners. One day while we were
on our way to the mess-hall, she waved her handkerchief to
us, but I suppose that the good Major was constrained to
prevent so unwise demonstrations afterwards. We did not
see her again.</p>

<p>The fresh sea breeze was very refreshing, and we sat up
nearly all night talking of home. Hunger, however, soon
asserted itself, and we had much difficulty in getting a small
piece of cold pork and some hard-tack. The next evening
we reached Fortress Monroe, where we expected that our
baggage would be searched or confiscated; but by some
good fortune it was allowed to pass, and we reached Varina,
ten miles below Richmond, without any trouble, although
nearly famished.</p>

<p>Our commissioner of exchange was expected to meet us,
but he was at church in Richmond with some fair lady, or
too happily engaged otherwise to hurry down to attend to
the wants of a few hundred prisoners who were half starved
and pining to be ashore again. So we remained many hours
within ten paces of the shore, before the necessary forms
were complied with and we were allowed to land. There
was some talk of sending us to Camp Lee to remain there
until we should be exchanged; but I was taken by a friend
in his carriage to Richmond, where we arrived at night. I
was surprised that my joy at my deliverance was not so
visible on my face that it would be noticed on the streets,
and I half expected that even strangers would congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
me. It was the 6th of October when I reached Richmond.
I had been a prisoner of war only three weeks, but it seemed
to me an eternity, and I can hardly realize now that the time,
counted by days and weeks, was really so short. And yet,
it must have been so.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The morning after my arrival at Richmond, I went down
to the head-quarters of General G. W. Smith, who was then
in command of the Department of Richmond, and asked his
Adjutant-General for leave of absence until I should be exchanged.
The Adjutant-General, who was no less a person
than Major Samuel W. Melton, of South Carolina, refused
point blank to allow me to leave the city. The officers and
men who had been paroled could not, of course, rejoin their
commands until they should have been exchanged, and
there seemed to be no object in keeping them in Richmond.
It was feared, however, that if they were allowed to go
home, some of them might not return promptly; and for
this reason no leaves were to be granted. As usual in such
cases, the many were to suffer for the possible faults of the
few. In my own case there was certainly no reason to
refuse a leave of absence, as if I had desired to leave the
service I could have done so at any time by resigning. The
Conscript law of course did not affect me, and it seemed
rather absurd to suppose that one who was in the Confederate
service by his own choice would keep away from the field
of duty which he had deliberately selected. I went to my
friend, Colonel Gorgas, the Chief of Ordnance, made my
official report of the capture of the trains at Williamsport,
and through him obtained from the Secretary of War permission
to go down to Sussex, and remain there until the completion
of the exchange of the paroled prisoners.</p>

<p>After remaining at Petersburg a few days, I went on to
Sussex, and found my friends there in great distress. Mrs.
Raines had died the day before my arrival, and the loss to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
her husband and family seemed irreparable. To me, also,
it was a heavy blow, for Mrs. Raines had been to me from
the beginning a good and true friend. I stayed awhile with
Major Belsches, about two miles away, and then went over
to Oakland, where I had the complete rest and quiet I
so much needed. The change from the dreary confinement
and brutal treatment at Fort Delaware to the ease and
abundance at Oakland was sufficient to make any one happy.</p>

<p>The days passed swiftly by, and it was not until the latter
part of November that I was exchanged and free to return
to the army. A fresh horse was now necessary, and I
bought in Petersburg, for $400, a good-looking black charger,
which turned out to be an utterly good-for-nothing animal.
From Petersburg, I rode, by way of Richmond, to Fredericksburg,
where General Longstreet now was. I reported
for duty on December the 6th, and set to work at once to familiarize
myself with the condition of my department. Lieutenant
Leech did not return to us, but was assigned to duty
with General Pickett as Chief of Ordnance of the division.
Lieutenant Duxberry I found at head-quarters in much the
same condition as when I left him at South Mountain.
Very soon, the whole responsibility in the Ordnance Department
of Longstreet’s Corps devolved upon me. Colonel
Manning had no taste for anything but marching and fighting,
and Lieutenant Duxberry was too fond of pleasure and
show to be of much practical use.</p>

<p>I was under canvas at this time a few hundred yards from
Guinea Station. The weather was bitterly cold, but my
tent was small, and with the aid of a large stove I managed
to keep reasonably warm. There was, as yet, no
particular deficiency in the Commissary Department, but
there was not much variety in the food. Bacon was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
great staple, with occasional rations of beef, so tough
that it deserved to be described, as it once was, as “the
sinews of war.” The fat of the bacon was used in place
of lard, in making bread and biscuits, so that when the
bacon itself was served it was particularly dry. There
was so great a craving for a change in the food that I ate
often with relish a sauce composed of bacon fat and brown
sugar, which in these days is sickening to think of. One of
my men captured somewhere a keg of lard which proved to
be a great acquisition. I think I may safely say that it was
not paid for.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX.</a></h2>


<p>The battle of Fredericksburg was at hand. I need not
describe it, except to say that from Howison’s Hill, afterwards
known as Lee’s Hill, where Generals Lee and Longstreet
and their staffs remained for a considerable part of the
day, there was a magnificent view of as grand a spectacle
as one could desire to see in war. I was there soon after
daybreak, and as the mist of the morning cleared away we
could easily make out the enemy’s movements. Large
bodies of troops had already crossed the Rappahannock,
and the fields near it were blue with Yankees. On the opposite
shore were the long trains of wagons and ambulances,
together with the reserve artillery. A 30-pound Parrot
gun which we had was ordered to open on the enemy, and
very soon the artillery fire became brisk. Fredericksburg,
which had been so calm and peaceful in the early light, was
set on fire by the enemy’s shells. The enemy now made a
fierce attack on our right, which was repulsed with comparative
ease. It was thrilling to watch the long line advance,
note the gaps in the array, as the wounded fell or
else staggered to the rear, and see the gallant remnant melt
away like snow before our withering fire. At Marye’s Hill,
which was the key to our position, the most desperate
fighting was done. Again and again the enemy charged,
only to be driven back with terrible slaughter. There it
was that Meagher’s Brigade made its historic charge. The
field in front of the hill, beyond the road, was well called
the slaughter-pen. The enemy lay there in their ranks, as
they had fallen, and the fence was riddled like a sieve by
the rifle bullets. I had a very narrow escape. Standing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a group with three other officers watching the action, a shell
exploded near us and bruised or wounded everyone of my
companions. I was not touched.</p>

<p>Late at night I returned to camp, and crept into a wagon
to take a quiet sleep, placing my coat, cap and trousers
under my head, in the front part of the wagon. In the
morning my coat was missing, and the natural conclusion
was that it had been stolen. Such things did happen.
Looking about rather disconsolately, and wondering how
I was to replace the missing garment, I saw some buttons
and shreds of gold lace lying on the ground. The
thieves were discovered. It was the wretched mules,
who had unceremoniously dragged my clothes out of
the wagon and chewed up my uniform coat, in place of
the long forage, the hay or fodder, which they craved.
The mules, at this time, were fed on corn almost exclusively;
and their desire for rough food, as it was called, led
them frequently to gnaw the poles of the wagons. These
poles on this account were protected in many cases by strips
of iron, which rendered them impervious to even the teeth of
a mule. I was in a sad dilemma, of course, and was laughed
at for my pains. Fortunately, I succeeded in buying a coat,
which answered my purposes until I reached Petersburg, in
the spring.</p>

<p>The army was now into winter quarters, the men making
themselves as comfortable as they could. Snow-balling was
a favorite amusement, and was carried on in grand style,
brigade challenging brigade to a sham fight. These contests
were very exciting, and were the source of great amusement
to the men. Practical jokes, too, were frequently
played upon the officers. Mrs. Longstreet was staying at a
house a mile or two from our head-quarters, and General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Longstreet rode over there every evening, returning to camp
in the morning. On his way he passed through the camp of
the Texas Brigade of Hood’s Division, and was frequently
saluted with a shower of snow-balls. For some time he took
it with his usual imperturbability, but he grew tired of the
one-sided play at last, and the next time that he was riding
by the Texans, and found them drawn up on the side of the
road, snow-balls in hand, he reined up his horse, and said to
them very quietly, “Throw your snow-balls men, if you
want to, as much as you please; but, if one of them touches
me, not a man in this brigade shall have a furlough this
winter. Remember that!” There was no more snow-balling
for General Longstreet’s benefit.</p>

<p>The officers at our head-quarters had a less innocent
amusement than pitching snow-balls. The great American
game of poker was played nearly every night. One of the
most successful of the gamesters was Major Walton, who was
a kinsman of General Longstreet, through whose influence
he had received an appointment in the Commissary Department.
He really did general staff duty. At one sitting
Walton won $2,000 or more from Dr. Maury, who was
one of the Surgeons of the corps; and he caused much unfavorable
comment by sending to Dr. Maury for his winnings
before that gentleman was out of bed in the morning.
There was hard drinking as well as high playing; and it
was reported that at the close of one debauch General
Longstreet had played horse with one of the stronger
officers of his staff, who on all-fours carried Longstreet
around and around the tent until the pair of them rolled
over on the ground together.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of General Lee were in the woods, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>far from luxurious. He was advised by his physicians to
stay in one of the houses near by, as many of his officers
were doing, but he declined to fare any better than his men
did. There was no pomp or circumstance about his head-quarters,
and no sign of the rank of the occupant, other
than the Confederate flag displayed in front of the tent of
Colonel Taylor, the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to mention the scale of prices
that prevailed in the Confederacy towards the close of the
year 1862, as I gave them in a letter to my mother: Shoes
$30 a pair; common calico shirts $10 each; socks $1 a pair;
butter $2 a pound; turkeys $15 each; matches 50 to 75
cents a box; ink 25 cents a bottle; blacking $1 a cake;
writing paper $2 a quire.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">XX.</a></h2>


<p>Early in 1863 Longstreet was placed in command of the
Department of Virginia and North Carolina, with head-quarters
at Petersburg, and with Hood’s and Pickett’s Divisions
he moved to that place. An effort to capture Suffolk,
on the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad, was contemplated,
and most of our command moved in that direction. I remained
at Petersburg during the operations, which were
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It was, of course, very pleasant for me in the Cockade
City, and my pay had accumulated sufficiently to permit me
to provide myself with new uniforms, in the latest style and
at extravagant prices.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement in the city, in consequence
of an order that the pleasure horses of the citizens
should be impressed for the use of the artillery. To this
there was a very decided objection, and every manner of
device was resorted to save the pet animals. Some good
people attempted to run off their horses into the country,
but pickets had been stationed along the roads and the
fugitives were easily captured. When the impressing officers
went around to examine the horses in town, they found
horses in the cellars and even in the dining-rooms. A
carriage containing three ladies and drawn by a pair of fine
bay horses was going down Sycamore Street when a guard
ordered the driver to halt, and told the ladies that it was
his unpleasant duty to impress the team. The ladies, who
were young and pretty, declared that the horses should not
be taken. They tried both entreaty and expostulation, but
the guard was inexorable. The ladies then declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
if the horses were taken they must be taken too, and thought
they had gained the victory. The guard did go away,
but he quickly unhitched the traces, and took the horses
with him, leaving the ladies in their carriage in all their
glory. In some cases the impressment was useless, as delicate
horses were taken which were of no use for service in
the field.</p>

<p>The battle of Chancellorsville had been fought during our
stay around Petersburg, and the command was then hurried
back to the neighborhood of Fredericksburg. It was in
May, 1863, I think, that I returned there. The Gettysburg
campaign began, but before this I saw the review of the
whole cavalry of the army at Brandy Station. The enemy
came in upon us shortly afterwards, and, in the very beginning
of the cavalry fighting, Colonel Sol. Williams, of the
1st North Carolina, was killed. He had been married to
Miss Maggie Pegram, Captain Robert B. Pegram’s eldest
daughter, only about two weeks before. The Adjutant of
his regiment was John Pegram, Captain Pegram’s eldest
son, who was killed at Petersburg in 1864.</p>

<p>The march from Culpepper Court House through Chester
Gap, in the Blue Ridge, was very delightful to me, as the
weather was fine and the scenery was beautiful. I was
particularly struck with the scenery at Front Royal and
Shenandoah. The Valley of Virginia then showed few signs
of war.</p>

<p>This time we crossed the Potomac at Williamsport. It
was a dreary day! The rain was falling in torrents.
General Lee, General Longstreet and General Pickett were
riding together, followed by their staffs. When we reached
the Maryland shore we found several patriotic ladies with
small feet and big umbrellas waiting to receive the Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
who were coming a second time to deliver down-trodden
Maryland. As General Lee rode out of the water,
one of the ladies, with a face like a door-knocker, stepped
forward and said: “This is General Lee, I presume?”
General Lee gave an affirmative reply, and the lady continued:
“General Lee, allow me to bid you welcome to
Maryland, and allow me to present to you these ladies who
were determined to give you this reception&mdash;Miss Brown,
General Lee; Miss Jones, General Lee; Miss Smith,
General Lee.” General Lee thanked them courteously for
their attention, and introduced General Longstreet and
General Pickett to Miss Brown, Miss Jones and Miss Smith.
This was not the end of the affair, however, as one of the
ladies had an enormous wreath which she was anxious to
place on the neck of General Lee’s charger. The horse
objected to it seriously, and the wreath was turned over to
one of the couriers. The next morning we went into
Hagerstown, where more ladies were in waiting. There
were more presentations to General Lee and more introductions
for Generals Longstreet and Pickett. One fair
lady asked General Lee for a lock of his hair. General Lee
said that he really had none to spare, and he was quite sure,
besides, that they would prefer such a souvenir from one of
his younger officers, and that he was confident that General
Pickett would be pleased to give them one of his curls.
General Pickett did not enjoy the joke, for he was known
everywhere by his corkscrew ringlets, which were not particularly
becoming when the rain made them lank in such
weather as we then had. The ladies did not press the
request. When we resumed our march more ladies came
to be presented, but this time there were no petitions for a
lock of Pickett’s hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>It was some satisfaction for me to pass once more through
Greencastle, where I had been bedeviled by both men
and women when taken there by the cavalry who captured
me the year before. Thence we went to Chambersburg,
and I was amazed to find that hundreds of sturdy
well-dressed citizens were still in the town. In Virginia
there was hardly a white man to be found who was not in
the Confederate service, excepting the sick and those who
were too old or too infirm for any sort of military duty;
and it gave us a realizing sense of the strength of the enemy
to see that they could have so large armies in the field and
leave so many lusty men in peace at home.</p>

<p>The army behaved superbly in Pennsylvania. The
orders against straggling and looting were strict, and they
were cheerfully obeyed. It was on the march in Pennsylvania
that I saw General Lee, one morning, dismount from
his horse and replace the rails of the fence of a wheat field
which had been thrown down by some of our men. It was
the best rebuke that he could have given to the offenders.</p>

<p>At Chambersburg I paid a visit to the jail in which I had
been confined, and found a number of Yankee soldiers in
the yard. Had I been so minded, I might have played
upon them the malicious trick of which the Chambersburg
boys made us the objects when we were there. Riding
through the town, I recognized one of the citizens who had
been peculiarly kind to me when I was a prisoner, and who
had given me then an excellent dinner. I thought I would
catechise him a little, and called out in a loud voice:
“Halt, there!” He seemed rather nervous, and asked what
I would have. “Do you live here?” I asked. He said
that he did. “Did you live here last year?” He replied
in the affirmative. “Were you here in September last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
when a number of Confederate prisoners were brought in?”
He said, “Yes, I was, but I did nothing against them.”
Looking sternly at him I said, “Do you remember me?”
He said that he did not. “Well, sir,” I continued, “I was
one of those prisoners.” By this time he was badly frightened,
and I hastened to relieve him by saying that my
only object was to thank him for his kindness to me, and
ascertain if there was anything I could do for him in return.
He thanked me, but said that the town was so quiet that
he needed no protection.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I rode out of the town, and it was
dark before I came back. I was riding quite rapidly, and my
horse, striking his foot against one of the stepping stones in
the middle of the street, fell and threw me about ten feet
over his head. As I went down I heard a woman exclaim:
“Thank God, one of those wicked Rebels has broken his
neck.” I was not hurt, and my horse was not much injured,
so I remounted and, riding to the sidewalk, informed
my unseen foe that the pleasure she anticipated was, at least,
postponed.</p>

<p>The people generally were evidently greatly surprised at
the devotion of our men to General Lee, and made some
rough remarks about it. One old lady called out to an
officer of ours as he strode by: “You are marching mighty
proudly now, but you will come back faster than you went.”
“Why so, old lady?” he asked. “Because you put your
trust in General Lee and not in the Lord Almighty,” she
replied.</p>

<p>I should mention here that the horse which I was riding
was a fine black gelding, which I had bought on our way to
the Valley of Virginia. A more thoroughly trustworthy
animal I could not have had, and he stood fire splendidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I had two other horses at this time, but always rode in
action the black gelding I have just spoken of. I had intended
to have given him some fancy name, but my boy
Aleck dubbed him “Pete” the day I bought him, and by
that name he went.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI.</a></h2>


<p>On the march from Chambersburg we learned that General
Meade had been placed in command of the Union
Army, and we pushed on towards Gettysburg, where A. P.
Hill’s Corps had been heavily engaged. This day I was
prostrated by sickness, and rode in an ambulance until
nearly night, when I managed to get on my horse and go
down to the battle-field. Longstreet himself has described
admirably the fighting the next day; and, careless as he
generally was of himself under fire, he nowhere else exposed
himself more recklessly. One charge he led in person, and
some prisoners whom we captured, when they learned who
it was that had ridden in front of our advancing line, said
they might expect to get whipped when a Corps commander
exposed himself in that way to show his men how to fight.</p>

<p>The following day, July 3, the ever-memorable battle of
Gettysburg was fought. Every arrangement was made
to shell the enemy’s position, on Cemetery Hill, and
follow this up by an attack in force. The whole of
the long range guns in the army were placed in battery
along the low range of hills which we occupied, and
at three o’clock the cannonading began. The enemy
made prompt reply. Three or four hundred pieces of artillery
were being fired as rapidly as the cannoneers could load
them. Being in the centre of the front line, I had an excellent
view of the fight. It was a hellish scene. The air was
dotted with clouds of smoke where shells had burst, and the
fragments of shell and the solid shot were screaming and
shrieking in every direction. Through it all, General Longstreet
was as unmoved as a statue, watching placidly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
enemy’s lines. In the meanwhile Pickett’s Division had
been formed in readiness for the charge. Three of his brigades
were present; those of Kemper, Armistead and Garnett,
composed exclusively of Virginians. Prayers were
offered up in front of Armistead’s brigade and Garnett’s brigade,
before the advance began. Garnett remarked to Armistead:
“This is a desperate thing to attempt.” Brave old
Armistead replied: “It is; but the issue is with the Almighty,
and we must leave it in his hands.” Just then a hare
which had been lying in the bushes, sprang up and leaped
rapidly to the rear. A gaunt Virginian, with an earnestness
that struck a sympathetic chord in many a breast,
yelled out: “Run old heah; if I were an old heah I would
run too.” The artillery firing ceased, and the order to advance
was given. Pickett was in the centre, with Wilcox’s
Division on the right, and Pender’s, commanded by Pettigrew,
on the left. The thin grey line of Virginians moved
as steadily as on parade, the battle flags catching a deeper
red from the sun. Well in front of their brigades were
Kemper, and Garnett, and Armistead. The last named
was bare-headed, his grey locks floating in the breeze.
Waving his sabre and hat in hand, he cheered on his men.
They did what men could do; but more had been expected
of them than mortal men could accomplish. Armistead
was mortally wounded inside the enemy’s works. Garnett
was killed instantly. Kemper was severely wounded, and
supposed to be dying. My recollection is that only one
field officer in Pickett’s Division escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>The attack had been made and had failed. There was a
terrible gap in our line, and the enemy threatened to advance.
In the meanwhile the staff officers were busily engaged
in rallying the men, who had made their way back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from the front. I suppose that I was the first man to whom
Pickett spoke when he reached the line. With tears in his
eyes, he said to me: “Why did you not halt my men here?
Great God, where, oh! where is my division?” I told him
that he saw around him what there was left of it. General
Lee, of course, took all the blame on himself. As was well
said by a writer at this time: “General Lee was grand on
the smoke-crowned hills of Petersburg, on the sanguinary
field of Chancellorsville, and on the tragic plains of Manassas;
but when at Gettysburg he told his men, ‘It is my
fault’, he rose above his race, and communed with the
angels of heaven.” That sad night not more than three
hundred men remained to us of what had been one of the
finest divisions in the service. The remnants of the companies
were commanded by corporals and sergeants; regiments
by lieutenants; and a brigade by a Major. Never
had Virginia suffered a heavier blow. The division was
composed of the flower of her children, and there was weeping
and desolation in every part of the Old Dominion.</p>

<p>It was in every way an ugly time. There was always
considerable difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of
artillery ammunition. The first trouble was in making it,
and the second was in finding transportation for it. At no
time did we have so large a reserve as was necessary. What
was true of the artillery was true in a less degree of the
infantry. There was even some delay on our march into
Pennsylvania in consequence of the detention of a train of
ordnance wagons, which did not arrive when expected. A
brigade of infantry with a battery of artillery, was sent as
an escort; for had that train been captured it would have
been risking too much to advance farther. The terrible
cannonade on the third day at Gettysburg exhausted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
whole of the artillery ammunition in reserve. My recollection
is, that there was no long range ammunition left except
what was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in the caisons'">in the caissons</ins> and limber chests. Under
such circumstances, and having lost so heavily in the attack
on Cemetery Hill, General Lee determined to retreat to
Virginia; but we lay one day at least on the field awaiting
the attack which Meade did not venture to make. The
Union forces had suffered severely; but they could stand
the loss of men better than we could; and they had a right
to claim Gettysburg as a decisive victory, for we had failed
utterly in what we had undertaken.</p>

<p>The march back to the Potomac was dreary and miserable
indeed. The rain fell in torrents. The clothing of the
men was worn and tattered, and too many of them were
without shoes. It was a heart-breaking business, and gloom
settled down upon the army. The enemy’s cavalry made
an attempt to cut us off at Williamsport, where the river
was too high for fording, and they would have succeeded
but for the gallantry of the wagoners and “Company Q”
(the stragglers, and the disabled men with the trains), who
had a free fight with them, and drove them back. We crossed
the river on a pontoon bridge, leaving the cavalry in the
entrenchments at Williamsport, and plodded our way back
towards Winchester. Just about this time we received the
news of the fall of Vicksburg. It needed only this to intensify
the feeling that the star of the Confederacy was setting.</p>

<p>Passing from grave to gay, I may mention here that a sad
trick was played on me by Captain Innes Randolph, an Engineer
officer at our head-quarters. While we were at Bunker
Hill, on the way to Winchester, he invited me to dine
with him, saying that his mess had a very fine ’possum,
which would be a novelty to me if I had not tasted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
succulent dish. It was finely served, and merited the encomiums
that Randolph lavished upon it. He was careful,
besides, to tell me that I should find, as I did, that it tasted
very much like roast sucking pig. Two or three years afterwards
Randolph told me that this famous dish was not
’possum after all, but a sucking pig which he had bagged in the
neighborhood, and which he had dubbed ’possum in order
to spare me the pain of banqueting on a dish that I knew
to be &mdash;&mdash; I was going to say “stolen,” but we called it
“captured” in the army.</p>

<p>Resuming our march, we passed through Millwood and
Chester Gap, where we had a slight skirmish with the enemy.
One of our brigades charged across a field which was
thick with blackberry bushes. The fruit was ripe, and as
the men moved forward firing they would pick the blackberries
and hastily eat them. No troops ever showed more
indifference to danger, or took fighting more as a matter of
course, than the veterans of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>We went into camp at Culpepper Court House, and remained
there a considerable time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII.</a></h2>


<p>The army rapidly recovered its tone, and we heard that
one corps of the three was to be sent to Tennessee. The
choice fell upon Longstreet, who took with him Hood’s and
McLaws’ Divisions of Infantry and Alexander’s Battalion of
Artillery. Pickett’s Division was left in Virginia to recruit.
There was much for me to do preparing for the change of
base, and I was permitted to remain a day or two in Richmond
on the way to the West. I stayed in Richmond at
the house of Mr. John H. Tyler, the father of Henry Tyler,
who was one of the Ordnance Sergeants with us, and a most
excellent fellow. From the first time that I went to Richmond
after I made his acquaintance, Mr. and Mrs. Tyler
made their house like a home to me; and until the end of
the war, and long afterward, a chair was kept as regularly
for me at their table as though I had been one of their sons.
Their generous and unaffected kindness to me, year after
year, was more than I could ever hope to repay. God bless
them.</p>

<p>I was a day or two later than the corps in leaving Richmond;
but the cars were crowded with our soldiers, and
when we reached South Carolina we received attentions
which had long ceased to be common in Virginia, where
the passage of large bodies of troops was an every day occurrence.
At Sumter, South Carolina, a number of ladies
were waiting for us on the platform, armed with bouquets
of flowers and with well filled baskets of cake, fruit and
more substantial fare. There was an abundance, too, of
lemonade for the dusty soldiers. But the good things were
for the soldiers only. Some ladies in the car were evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
faint with long fasting, and a civilian who was with them
asked a very pretty girl, who had a large dish of cake and
sandwiches, to give him a piece of the cake for a lady in the
car who really needed it. With the mercilessness which one
woman usually shows to another, the fair young patriot
told him jauntily that everything there was for the soldiers,
and that ladies and civilians must look out for themselves.
Our men were rather unaccustomed to so much kindness, in
these days, but they enjoyed it thoroughly. At Augusta,
and at Atlanta, also, we were most hospitably received.</p>

<p>I overtook the command and General Longstreet shortly
after their arrival at Chickamauga Station, and we had the
satisfaction of knowing that it was “the Virginia troops,”
as they were called, to whom was mainly due the glory of
the victory we won at Chickamauga. Our loss was severe,
and Colonel Manning, my immediate superior, was slightly
wounded and placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. This left me in name,
as in fact, in charge of the Ordnance Department of the
corps.</p>

<p>I wish that I could remember precisely what took place
the next day, when I went with Major Walton to find General
McLaws, in the neighborhood of Chattanooga. We
were exceedingly anxious that he should drive right on
after the enemy, but he made the objection at once that
the movement might not be successful, and would be sure
to be attended with heavy loss. He said, however, that he
would make the advance if we gave him an imperative order
in General Longstreet’s name to do so. This order we declined
to give, to my present regret, and General McLaws
contented himself with asking General Longstreet to send
him some more ambulances. When we reached General
Longstreet late that night, and told him what General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
McLaws had said, his only remark was a wish that the ambulances
were in a hotter place than Chattanooga. Longstreet
did not love McLaws, and preferred charges against
him afterwards for neglect of duty in the attack on Fort
Sanders, at Knoxville.</p>

<p>The whole army came up, and the investment of Chattanooga
began. Our head-quarters were in the low ground,
which was always under water in winter, but we managed
tolerably well as long as fine weather lasted. Soon the rain
began to fall steadily, and it was a difficult matter so to
arrange the ditches around our tents as to save ourselves
from being washed away at night.</p>

<p>Frank Vizetelly, the artist and correspondent of the
<cite>Illustrated London Times</cite>, joined us here; and with him was
Captain Ross, of the Austrian service. Ross was of Scotch
descent, but was born in Austria, and belonged to one of
the crack light cavalry regiments. There was a good deal
of merry-making, and it was no uncommon thing to see a
half dozen officers, late at night, dancing the “The Perfect
Cure,” which was one of the favorite songs of the day in
the London music halls, and was introduced to our notice
by Vizetelly.</p>

<p>There were sharp discussions occasionally as to what
should take place when the war should be over and the independence
of the Confederate States was assured. Major
Walton I had always disliked heartily, and in one of our
conversations he said that, when the Confederate States
enjoyed their own government, they did not intend to have
any “d&mdash;d foreigners” in the country. I asked him what
he expected to become of men like myself, who had given
up their own country in order to render aid to the Confederacy.
He made a flippant reply, which I answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rather warmly, and he struck at me. I warded off the
blow, and slapped his face. The next morning I sent him
a challenge by Captain Ross. Walton, however, did not
want a fight at this time, and offered to make an ample
apology in writing. A day or two passed, and as no apology
came I sent Ross to him again. Walton now took
the position that he had been hasty in his action, and that
if he had not promised to do it he would not make an
apology at all. Ross told him very quietly, in his quaint
way, that he must please consider everything blotted out
that had taken place since he had borne the challenge, and
that we would begin it again at that point and settle the
affair in any way that Walton preferred. This brought
Walton to terms, and he made the apology I required.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>The position of the army in front of Chattanooga was not
as strong as we supposed, and the enemy succeeded in reopening
their communications and obtaining supplies.
There was no longer any expectation that we should be
able to starve them out, and it was determined to make a
diversion in another direction. The plan was to detach
Longstreet, who should pass down the Sweet Water Valley
and capture Burnside’s forces which were in the neighborhood
of Knoxville. Before going away, I was exceedingly
anxious to complete the equipment of our corps, but
Bragg’s Chief of Ordnance, Colonel Oladowski, was inordinately
fond of red tape, and I should have been in bad
plight but for a quantity of Enfield rifles I had prudently
brought from Virginia with me. Oladowski could outcurse
any man in the army I ever met, except Jubal Early and
M. W. Gary. It was one of his boasts that he had
“evacuate Murphreysboro with zee whole army and lose
only one grindstone.” It disgusted him, too, that Colonel
Manning should have been wounded. He said to me: “My
friend! what for Colonel Manning he go into zee fight?”
I told him it was the custom of our Ordnance officers to do
so. “I tell you sar,” said Oladowski, “he not go into zee
fight for love zee country. I know! I know! he go into
zee fight to get promotion and zee little furlough. Vell!
vell! vell! I wish I was in h&mdash;ll ten year before dis war
begin!”</p>

<p>I learned afterwards that Oladowski was the Ordnance
Sergeant at the Baton Rouge Arsenal at the time the war
began, and, of course, not a man of education or position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
He was a good-hearted fellow, but I fear that after the
disastrous defeat of Bragg’s army at the battle of Missionary
Ridge, after Longstreet’s departure, he could not
well have congratulated himself on having lost “only one
grindstone.”</p>

<p>Early in November we left Chattanooga, and marched
by the Sweet Water Valley and Loudon to Knoxville. One
of General Longstreet’s most serious faults as a military
commander was shown at this time. To his knowledge we
were to cut loose from our communications, with no certainty
that we should soon be able to re-establish them. It
would indeed be easy enough to live upon the country, but
we could not hope to find in the fields or the corn-cribs
either small-arm or artillery ammunition. Nevertheless, he
gave me no notice whatever that any extended movement
was to be made, nor did he warn me that I must be prepared
to supply the army with ammunition for the campaign.
Not one word was said to me by him on the subject. I had
an inkling, however, of what was going on, and obtained ample
supplies. Had I not done so, we should have been in an
awkward predicament by the time that we reached Knoxville.
Had anything been lacking, it is certain that the
blame would have been placed on me. It is evident that it
was Longstreet’s duty, as a prudent commander, to confer
with the chiefs of the several staff departments, ascertain
from them what was the condition of their supplies, and
inform them what was likely to be required. If he had not
such confidence in them as would permit him to give them
the necessary information, he should have removed them
and put in their places officers whom he could trust. It is
certain that he could have given the requisite instructions
without divulging the details of the movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>At Loudon we found that the enemy had destroyed the
bridge across the Tennessee River and had smashed some
locomotives and cars which had been left there. The process
was very simple. The trains were made up, and when
there was a full head of steam the throttles of the locomotives
were opened, and they were allowed to whirl along the
track until they reached the parapet of the bridge, whence
they bounded into the river below.</p>

<p>Crossing the river on an unstable pontoon bridge, we
found ourselves within striking distance of Burnside’s Corps
at Lenoir Station. For two days there was sharp fighting
with the enemy’s rear guard. Then our opportunity came.
McLaws was ordered to press on to Campbell’s Station,
while Hood’s Division, under Jenkins, took the road which
follows the line of the railroad to Lenoir Station. Jenkins
made a vigorous advance, and Burnside found it impracticable
to move all his artillery and wagons. Some hundred
of the latter, loaded with subsistence stores, ammunition
and implements, were disabled and abandoned. The cannon
powder lay on the ground four or five inches deep.
It was a pleasant place where to smoke a quiet pipe,
and several of my men indulged themselves in that
way to my great discomfort. The expectation was that
McLaws would reach the intersecting road in time to cut
off Burnside, but McLaws was behind time, as usual, and
we did not bag our game. General Sam Jones has just
published an account of the Knoxville campaign, and I give
here what he says about the failure to intercept Burnside:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The march on the 16th was a race for position, but a slow one, because of
the condition of the roads. McLaws was ordered to march as rapidly as possible
to the intersection of the road on which he was marching with that which
Jenkins was following, in the hope of reaching it before the Federals. General
Longstreet was eager to force his adversary to accept battle, and General Burnside
just as eager to avoid it until he could reach Knoxville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from Lenoir to Campbell’s Station is about eleven miles.
Jenkins’ instructions were to press the enemy vigorously and do his utmost to
bring him to bay. The advance and rear guards were several times hotly engaged,
the latter halting only long enough to cover the retreat and then following.
About 11 o’clock Jenkins’ division reached the junction of the two roads
about a mile from Campbell’s Station. McLaws’ Division had not arrived,
and the Federals had passed it.</p>

<p>General McLaws’ orders were to move rapidly to Campbell’s Station and
endeavor to reach that point before the Federals. His march during this day,
the 16th, was as rapid as the condition of the roads would permit, and not
materially retarded by the troops that General Hartranft had sent forward for
the purpose, a small body of Colonel Hart’s cavalry keeping back the enemy’s
skirmisher’s with but slight loss. By the time McLaws reached the vicinity of
Campbell’s Station the Federals had been so closely pressed by Hood’s Division
as to be obliged to face about and form line of battle, which they did about a
mile from the station. When McLaws arrived he was ordered to deploy three
of his brigades in front of the enemy and to put his other brigade (Humphrey’s)
upon a ridge on his left, to threaten the enemy’s right, but not to show his division
beyond the woods skirting the plain towards Campbell’s Station. Colonel
Alexander placed his artillery in position and General Jenkins ordered three of
his brigades, McLaws’ and Anderson’s, supported by Benning’s, around the
enemy’s left flank, the movement being concealed by a wooded ridge, with instructions
to attack vigorously. McLaws was to attack in front when he should
hear Jenkins’ guns.</p>

<p>This flank movement, which did not escape the vigilance of the Federals,
caused them to fall back, a rather difficult and hazardous move to make in the
face or an enemy. McLaws’ Division advanced promptly and brought them
to a stand in their second and stronger position, about a mile further towards
Knoxville. The ground over which McLaws’ and Anderson’s Brigades had
to move to strike the enemy’s left and rear was very rough; over steep hills
covered with a thick growth of scrub oak, which necessarily delayed them,
while they were exposed to the fire of the enemy’s artillery. Before McLaws’,
Benning’s and Anderson’s Brigades reached the left of the enemy’s position
that position had been abandoned for the second and stronger one.</p>

<p>General Longstreet earnestly desired a general engagement and did his
utmost to compel his adversary to accept it before reaching Knoxville, rightly
judging, it would seem, that to do so offered the best prospect for the success
of his expedition. The opportunity was offered at Campbell’s Station. General
Burnside was forced to halt there and form line of battle to cover his
trains, which obstructed the road by which he was retreating. He held his
position there six or seven hours, but before the Confederates could be placed
in position night came on so dark and rainy that the attack could not be made.
Ably seconded by his officers and the steadiness of his troops he skilfully
extricated his command from a perilous position.</p>

<p>“If,” says General Longstreet, “General Jenkins could have made his attack
during this movement (the withdrawal from the first to the second position) or
if he could have made it after the enemy had taken his second position, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
must have destroyed this force, recovered East Tennessee, and in all probability
captured the greater part of the enemy’s forces.” When such an opportunity
is lost in a campaign blame is generally attached to some one or more commanders;
and this was not an exception to the general rule. But when the
weather and the condition of the roads is considered it is not surprising that
their movements were not as rapid as could have been wished. The weather
was most unfavorable; frequent rains, especially on the 13th and 14th, had
rendered the steep and rugged roads almost impassable for artillery and wagons.</p></div>

<p>Burnside fell back to Knoxville, and we went into camp
around the town. The principal defensive work was Fort
Sanders, which had walls twenty feet high, with a ditch ten
feet deep. Efforts were made to guard the river, both below
and above Knoxville, so as to prevent Burnside from
receiving supplies or reinforcements, and the works were
occasionally shelled. There was a good deal of delay, for
one reason and another, and we were so near the town that
we could hear the tunes played by the band at Fort Sanders.
The favorite air then was: “When this Cruel War is
Over.” Finally, an attack was ordered to be made on Fort
Sanders, but, although our men fought with their usual gallantry,
they were driven back. This was on the 29th of
November. In front of the fort trees had been cut, so as
to fall with their branches outward, and wires had been
stretched from stump to stump to trip up any assailants.
Our men struggled through the abattis under a deadly fire,
and some of them crossed the ditch and climbed up the
parapet, but they were hurled back by the defenders of the
fort, and thrown into the ditch. Hand grenades were used
by the garrison with great effect. A second assault was
tried, but equally in vain. These attacks cost us about five
hundred men.</p>

<p>In one of the attacks we made, Captain Winthrop, of the
44th Foot, in the English army, who was on leave of absence,
and had been with us for some time, behaved with the
most brilliant gallantry. We were taking a hasty lunch in
the breastworks under fire as the assault began, and Winthrop
rode off to see what was going on. Finding that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
troops were advancing, he rode out in front of the line and
right up to the enemy’s works, striking with his sword at
the soldiers who held them. In less time than it takes to
tell it he was lying on the ground with a big hole in his
collar bone. It was a very painful wound, but he recovered.</p>

<p>The attack on Knoxville having failed utterly, and
tidings having been received of the defeat of Bragg, at
Missionary Ridge, Longstreet raised the siege, and retreated
to Virginia. The rest of the winter we passed on the line
of railroad between Knoxville and Bristol, my head-quarters
being at Russellville. The men suffered frightfully. It is
no exaggeration to say that on such marches as they were
obliged to make in that bitter weather they left the bloody
tracks of their feet on the sharp stones of the roads.</p>

<p>It was a bleak, desolate, inhospitable country, yet we
managed to have a merry Christmas, although there was
considerable difficulty in getting the requisite quantum of
brandy to make egg-nog with. The medical staff had plenty
of whiskey and brandy, for the sick and wounded, and a good
deal of the stimulants went, I am sure, to those who did not
require them. There were some stills in the neighborhood,
and there was active demand for all the liquor these could
supply. I have known our people to fill their canteens with
the apple jack, as it dropped from the end of the worm, and
drink it delightedly, as soon as by immersing the canteen in
a branch they had cooled the liquor sufficiently to allow it
to be gulped down. I sent Henry Tyler on Christmas Eve
to a place ten or fifteen miles away to get a canteen of apple
jack for our Christmas egg-nog. Morning came, and he did
not return. We were very uneasy, as the woods were the
favorite lurking place of bushwhackers. As one of my
men explained, “there was a whacker in every bush.” In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
middle of the day Tyler turned up. Overcome by the cold
or fatigue, he had gone to sleep in the middle of the road,
and when he awoke in the morning he found an empty canteen
by his side, and his horse standing a few paces off.
But it was a hard winter, in spite of egg-nog and apple jack.</p>

<p>Finding that there was no probability of an early move,
I asked permission to go down to Richmond for a few days.
Leave was given me, but I had to ride about sixty miles in
intensely cold weather, on a fiendishly obstinate and perverse
mule, to reach Bristol, where I took the cars for
Richmond. By this time Confederate soldiers were treated
with scant respect by the railroad officials. On our way to
the Sweet Water Valley, I remember the conductor quietly
stopped the train and told us that we should not go on,
unless we cut a supply of wood for his engine. But it was
worse on the train that was to take us to Lynchburg.
There was no fire in the cars at night, and I really thought
I should have frozen. The men in the cars stood it as long
as they could, and, when they found that the conductor
would do nothing for them, they deliberately broke up the
blinds of the car, and with these made a fire which furnished
sufficient warmth to keep us from freezing. Had the conductor
resisted, I believe the indignant Confederates would
have killed him; and in that case a jury of soldiers, at all
events, would have returned a verdict of justifiable homicide.</p>

<p>While at Mr. Tyler’s, at Richmond, I found that I had
been recommended very strongly for promotion to the
rank of Captain; but was informed that it was necessary
that I should stand an examination before the recommendation
could be complied with. It seemed rather an absurd
thing that I should be required to be examined, when General
Longstreet and Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Ordnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
officer of General Lee’s army, had shown by their recommendations
that I was fully qualified for the duties that I had to
discharge. So I went to Mr. Seddon, the Secretary of War,
and told him what I thought of it. Kind old man as he was,
he listened to me very patiently when I explained to him
that I had been too long in the field to know as much as a
youngster who had just been graduated from college, and
that if my promotion depended upon my familiarity with
Conic Sections and the Calculus, I should probably remain
a Lieutenant all my life. Mr. Seddon said it was necessary
to undergo an examination, but he would make an endorsement
upon the papers that would put me in a proper position.
The endorsement was this: “The Board, in examining
Lieutenant Dawson for promotion, will make due allowance
for any deficiency in theoretical knowledge which may have
been caused by the engrossing nature of his duties in the
field.”</p>

<p>When I returned to head-quarters, I found that Colonel
Manning had recovered; and a Board, consisting of Manning
and two Captains of Artillery, was appointed to examine
me. The examination was both written and oral. I was
to answer in writing certain questions which had been sent
from Richmond, and was then to be examined by the
members of the Board. The written examination was
rather wide in its scope, as it ranged from questions so
simple as: “What is the centre of gravity?” and “What
is a logarithm?” to such a question as this: “With a gun
of a given calibre and at a given elevation, and with a given
charge of powder and a projectile of a given weight, what
will be the velocity of the projectile as it passes the muzzle
of the piece?” My answer to some such question as this
was: “I don’t know.” The oral examination was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
funny, as Colonel Manning insisted that the calibre of a
10-pound Parrott was three inches, although I assured him
it was only two and nine-tenths. As may be imagined,
taking Colonel Manning’s lack of familiarity with Ordnance
duty into account and the suggestive endorsement of the
Secretary of War, I passed my examination with flying
colors.</p>

<p>Colonel Manning was taken ill and obliged to leave us
for a time, and there was no event of importance, except a
change in my head-quarters from Russellville to Abingdon,
until April, 1864, when we were ordered to Gordonsville.
On our way there I stopped to see Colonel Manning, who
was being taken care of at a private house at Charlottesville,
and to my great joy received from him my commission as
Captain of Artillery, dated April 2d, 1864.</p>

<p>On May 4th, Grant crossed the Rapidan, and the Wilderness
Campaign began. General Lee put his troops in
motion, and the next morning Ewell attacked Warren’s
Corps. Grant immediately ordered Hancock to attack A.
P. Hill, and the battle raged until night. The fight was
renewed the next morning, when Hill was driven back in
some confusion. It was a critical moment for our army.
Longstreet arrived in time to change the tide of battle.
Kershaw’s Division was in front, and the men were eager
to show their old comrades that they had not become
demoralized in the West. Without a pause, they formed
in line of battle, arrested the enemy’s advance, and drove
him rapidly back. General Lee put himself at the head of
the troops to conduct the attack in person, but the men
swarmed around him, telling him, with tears in their eyes,
that he must go back, and that if he would go back they
would make short work of the enemy. Everything went
well with us for some time. General Longstreet ascertained
that the left of the enemy’s line extended but a short
distance beyond the Plank-road, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Sorrell, the Adjutant-General of Longstreet’s Corps, was
sent to conduct the brigades of Mahone, G. T. Anderson
and Wofford around the enemy’s left, and attack him on his
left and rear. They did this with perfect success, and the
enemy fell back with heavy loss to a position about three-quarters
of a mile from our front. It was the moment to
make a bold stroke for victory. The whole of Longstreet’s
Corps, with R. H. Anderson’s Division, was to be thrown
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> against the staggering enemy. Longstreet, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Colonel Sorrel, Captain Manning, of the Signal Corps, and
myself, with some couriers, rode down the Plank-road at
the head of our column. Just then, General Jenkins, who
commanded a South Carolina brigade in our corps, rode
up, his face flushed with joy, and, shaking hands with Longstreet,
congratulated him on the result of the fight. Turning
then to his brigade, which was formed in the road, Jenkins
said: “Why do you not cheer, men?” The men cheered
lustily, and hardly had the sound died away when a withering
fire was poured in upon us from the woods on our
right. Jenkins, rising in his stirrups, shouted out: “Steady,
men! For God’s sake, steady!” and fell mortally wounded
from his saddle. Longstreet, who had stood there like a
lion at bay, reeled as the blood poured down over his
breast, and was evidently badly hurt. Two of General Jenkins’
staff were killed by the same volley. What others
thought I know not. My own conviction was that we had
ridden into the midst of the enemy, and that nothing
remained but to sell our lives dearly. The firing ended as
suddenly as it began, and we then learned that Longstreet
had been wounded and Jenkins had been killed, as Jackson
was, by the fire of our own men. It was but the work of
a few minutes. We lifted Longstreet from the saddle, and
laid him on the side of the road. It seemed that he had
not many minutes to live. My next thought was to
obtain a surgeon, and, hurriedly mentioning my purpose, I
mounted my horse and rode in desperate haste to the
nearest field hospital. Giving the sad news to the first
surgeon I could find, I made him jump on my horse, and
bade him, for Heaven’s sake, ride as rapidly as he could
to the front where Longstreet was. I followed afoot. The
flow of blood was speedily staunched, and Longstreet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
placed in an ambulance. Poor Jenkins also received every
attention, but remained insensible until he died.</p>

<p>The disaster which had befallen us arrested for a time
the movement of the troops, for none but Longstreet
knew what General Lee’s intentions were. Sadly riding
back, surrounding the ambulance, we met General Lee, and
I shall not soon forget the sadness in his face, and the
almost despairing movement of his hands, when he was
told that Longstreet had fallen. It was a few minutes after
twelve o’clock when Longstreet was hit, and General
C. W. Field, the ranking Division Commander, took command
of the corps. It was four o’clock when the attack
was made. By this time, the shattered lines in our front had
been restored, and our movement was unsuccessful. It seemed
a fatality that our onslaught should have been arrested at
the moment when the promise of victory was brightest. So
ended the Battle of the Wilderness, May 6, 1864.</p>

<p>The next day I ascertained how the sad accident had
happened. The woods are very dense in the Wilderness,
and the dust was so thick as to reduce every tree and shrub
to one uniform shade of gray. Mahone’s Brigade, which had
formed part of the flanking column, was drawn up parallel
with the Plank-road, and about sixty yards from it. The
6th Virginia became detached from the regiments on its
right or left, and lost its position in the woods. When the
6th Virginia, isolated as it was, heard the cheering in front,
the men supposed that the enemy were upon them. Without
orders one soldier discharged his piece, and a volley was
then fired by the whole line, with the mournful result I have
described.</p>

<p>General R. H. Anderson was now placed in command of
the corps, and with him my relations were pleasant from
the beginning. Indeed, we became close friends.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI">XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>From the Wilderness the army moved parallel with Grant
to Spotsylvania Court House, where we had some desperate
fighting. My usual good luck followed me, and I came no
nearer being hit than having a solid shot strike the place
where my feet had been resting a moment before.</p>

<p>Baffling Grant completely at Cold Harbor, and forcing
him to abandon the line on which he had promised to
“fight it out if it took all summer,” we found ourselves,
early in June, on our way to Petersburg, crossing the river
at Drury’s Bluff. We had with us the divisions of Pickett
and of Field, and were to move down the Turnpike towards
Petersburg, to occupy the lines from which General Beauregard
had withdrawn. This was on June 16th. It was a delightful
day, and General Anderson and his staff rode on a
considerable distance in advance of the troops. There was
no more expectation of encountering the enemy than we
should have of finding him in the streets of Charleston.
When we neared Chester, however, a Major Smith, who
was in haste to reach Petersburg, and had gone on
ahead, came tearing back “bloody with spurring and fiery
red with haste,” and without his hat. We were at a loss to
understand what this meant, and he had not breath enough
left to tell us at the moment. As soon as he could speak,
he said that near the point where the railroad crossed the
Turnpike he had seen the Yankees in the woods as thick as
bees; and a party of them was then engaged in tearing up
the line of railroad which formed the only means of communication
between the Confederate capital and Petersburg.
He was fired at, but his horse alone was hit; and it was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>lucky escape for us. Had we jogged on very much farther
we should have found ourselves in the hands of the enemy,
who, it seems, had pushed up from Bermuda Hundreds, on
finding that the lines in front of them had been vacated,
and were about to make good their occupation of the railroad.
We halted in the road until the leading regiment of
our column came up, when it was deployed in the woods,
and advanced until it struck the enemy. The next day an
effort was made to recover our lost line; and on the 18th
Pickett took it with a rush. Kershaw had gone on to Petersburg.
There we had our head-quarters until near the
end of June.</p>

<p>Petersburg had changed very much from the quiet, peaceful,
drowsy looking city it was when I first knew it. But it
was an agreeable place to be in, for one reason at least.
During the Wilderness campaign our rations had been reduced
to five ounces of bacon and twelve ounces of corn
meal daily, and the country was so bare that no additions
could be made to our scant fare. At Richmond and Petersburg
there was little difficulty in obtaining provisions of
every kind, the joke being, however, that housekeepers
took their money to market in a basket and brought home
in their pockets what they had bought for dinner.</p>

<p>The Petersburgers had accommodated themselves to the
changed conditions with curious completeness. Shell frequently
fell in or passed over the city, and it was no uncommon
thing for old citizens, standing in the street discussing
the prospects of the day, to step quietly around a
corner until an approaching shell had passed by, and then
resume their former place without even suspending their
conversation. The basements of houses were used in many
instances as bomb-proofs, the traverses being composed of
mattresses and bedding.</p>

<p>From Petersburg we went back to the North side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
James River, and on July 28th captured a piece of artillery
and some prisoners near the Long Bridge Road.</p>

<p>Early in August General Anderson was summoned to
Richmond for consultation with President Davis and General
Lee; and on August 7th we took the train for Mitchell
Station, where Kershaw’s Division soon arrived, and three
days later Fitz Lee’s Cavalry Division came up.</p>

<p>I should mention here that my friend Mr. Raines had
suffered a terrible loss. The enemy made a raid through
Sussex County and carried off a number of his negroes and
nearly the whole of his horses and mules. Fortunately,
the raiders feared that they might be cut off if they took
the road by Belsches’ Mill-pond to the Plank-road, and they
did not pass by Mr. Raines’ residence, which, therefore,
was not destroyed. One of my riding horses which I valued
very highly was carried off by the cavalry. Mr. Raines and
his family were not at home at the time, having gone to
Mechlenburg County, where his son-in-law, Dr. Wm. H.
Jones, resided. While I was at Petersburg I became very
unwell, and our Medical Director, Dr. Cullin, told me that
there was only one prescription that he knew of that would
cure me quickly, and that was a leave of absence. Leave
for fifteen days was given me, and I started off in an
ambulance to Sussex. When I reached there I found old
Davie, the butler (a counterpart of our own Levy, although
considerably older), in charge of the place, and the family
absent. This did not daunt me, although I was sadly disappointed.
I hired a buggy and went on to Mechlenburg.
The plantation of Dr. Jones was near Boydton, and I
remained there about two weeks. The family consisted
then of Dr. Jones and his wife, the eldest daughter of Mr.
Raines, and their little daughter Anna; with Miss Anna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Raines and Miss Patty Raines, the daughters of my old
friend; and Frank and Nat, his sons. Miss Pinkie Morton
and Miss Hattie Morton, nieces of Dr. Jones, and his wards,
were also there. The plantation was large and valuable,
the principal crop made on it being tobacco of a fine
quality. I found at the plantation a thoroughbred Belshazzar
colt, which I had bought in Tennessee; a fancy
looking cream-colored animal, with a long mane and tail,
of which I expected great things. His career was brief,
and not particularly glorious. When the Yankees made a
raid through Boydton, after General Lee’s surrender, they
visited Dr. Jones’ house and carried off my Belshazzar colt.
He was loose in the pasture, and they had considerable
difficulty in catching him, as he jumped over the fence
whenever they got him in a corner. It was only by surrounding
him that they caught him at last.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Yankees at Dr. Jones’ was infamous
in the extreme. Mrs. Jones was on her death-bed, but the
soldiers, after tying Dr. Jones and putting him under guard,
forced themselves into her bed-room, and there in her
presence broke open her bureau and carried off what valuables
they could find. It was well that they did no worse.</p>

<p>The object of our expedition to the Valley, to which I now
return, I have never thoroughly understood, but I presume
that it was to act in concert with General Early, and do
what mischief we could. From Mitchell Station we moved
through Culpepper and Flint Hill to Front Royal. The
weather was so beautiful that it was hard to believe that
we had any serious business before us. An effort was made
to obstruct our passage of the Shenandoah, a river which
is aptly named, if ever river was. With its clear waters
dancing and sparkling in the autumn sun, it deserved its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
title as “Fair Daughter of the Stars.” Wofford’s Brigade
was sent forward to attack the enemy’s cavalry, and,
according to our joke at head-quarters, “Wofford swung his
right and made a water-haul.” Seriously, he was charged by
the enemy, who had driven back our own cavalry, and was
compelled to retire with heavy loss. I think that his Ordnance
officer was among the killed.</p>

<p>The enemy withdrew, and from Front Royal we marched
down the Valley in pursuit. I then realized, as never
before, the devastation of war. Columns of smoke were
rising in every direction from burning houses and burning
barns. Each time that we lighted our pipes that day, it
was with the burning embers taken from the ruins of what
a few hours before had been a happy home. The brutal
Sheridan was carrying out his fell purpose, and was soon in
position to boast, ruthless braggart as he is! that “If a crow
wants now to fly over the Valley of Virginia, he must carry
his rations with him.” It was the penalty that the Virginians
of the Valley paid for their devotion to the Confederacy,
and, despite their fearful losses, the time never
came when a Confederate soldier could not obtain a crust
of bread from any Southern family there. They always
contrived to have something left, and whatever they had
they were ready to share with the ragged and hungry Confederates.</p>

<p>On the march, by the way, there was an exciting incident.
General Anderson, with the staff and couriers, was far
ahead of the infantry column, and we had a squadron of
cavalry as our escort and advance guard. A couple of shots
were suddenly fired, and in an instant our cavalry broke
and came clattering to the rear. The indignation of General
Anderson was painful to see. He cried out to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cavalry: “What manner of men do you call yourselves,”
and putting his hand involuntarily to his side, said: “Oh, if
I had my sabre!” Turning to his staff and couriers, he
said: “Charge those people in front,” pointing to the blue-coated
cavalry, who were as much astonished at coming
upon us as we were at meeting with them. It was a mutual
surprise. The staff with the couriers dashed at the handful
of cavalry who had driven in our advance guard, and we had
a glorious race down the Turnpike to the suburbs of Winchester.
I think we captured four or five Yankees, without
any loss on our side, and my share of the plunder was a
very good McClellan saddle and a small sum in greenbacks.
It was only fair, I suppose, that we should confiscate the
greenbacks which we found in the possession of the men we
captured, as we expected them to take possession of what
money we had whenever we were captured. It is true
that Confederate money was not likely to be as useful
to them as greenbacks were to us, but it would not have
been patriotic to make any distinction between the two
currencies. I had paid $5 in Richmond for blacking my
boots, and the negro who performed the office would have
felt himself well paid if I could have given him instead a
ten cent Yankee shin-plaster.</p>

<p>Near Charlestown, on August 26th, the enemy felt our
position to some purpose, and captured about one hundred
men belonging to the 15th South Carolina Regiment, of
Kershaw’s Brigade. Then we marched and counter-marched
and danced about in every direction, with no definite object
apparently, until September 3d, when we moved out from
Winchester, and attacked the enemy near Berryville, and
drove him away. It was at this time that the whole command
could have been gobbled up. We had only Kershaw’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Division with us, the cavalry having been sent off <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'on a reconnoissance'">on a reconnaissance</ins>.
The enemy, in overwhelming force, came
upon us, and General Anderson reached the conclusion
that nothing but audacity would save us. Presenting as
bold a front as if the whole of the Army of Northern Virginia
were with us, and bringing our wagon trains right up
to the line of battle, he opened on the enemy with our
artillery. To our great surprise and relief the game was
successful, and the enemy drew off. General Early arrived
the next morning, and his first salutation was: “General
Anderson, those Yankees came mighty near getting you
yesterday.” General Anderson’s only reply was: “Yes
General, and it is not your fault that they did not.” It was
a strange business anyway. General Anderson ranked General
Early, but did not wish to take command of his troops,
as he would necessarily have done had the two commands
operated together. The result was that the two commands
swung corners and chasséed in every direction to no good
purpose, that any of us could see. It was a delightful sort
of military pic-nic, and in that sense everybody enjoyed it.</p>

<p>In September we were ordered back to Culpepper, and
the march through the Luray Valley, in delicious weather,
put us in excellent spirits. General Anderson said to me
one morning, looking up at the blue peaks which were
frowning down upon us, that it would <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'be the heighth'">be the height</ins> of
happiness, for him, to lie on the top of one of those mountains
all day long and roll rocks down its rugged sides.</p>

<p>The day before we reached Culpepper I found myself
very nearly afoot. Two of my horses were missing, and so
was my servant, Aleck. This boy had been with me from
the time that I returned from Fort Delaware, and was as
faithful a servant as one could desire to have. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
charge of my clothes, and generally kept my purse. No
one could have been more conscientious and trustworthy
than he appeared to be; but he was gone this time, and so
were the horses. Taking one of the couriers, an Alabamian,
named Spencer (who was afterwards appointed Aide-de-Camp
to Colonel Sorrell, when that officer was promoted to the
rank of Brigadier-General), I rode back in pursuit of the
runaway. For two days and nights we kept on his trail,
but were unable to overtake him, and as we were uncomfortably
near the main body of the enemy’s troops, we returned
to Culpepper, finding that our people had reached that place
just in time to drive off a raiding party which had pounced
down upon the village. Long afterwards I met Aleck in
Petersburg, and asked him what he meant by stealing my
horses. He grinned and said: “Mas’r Frank, I didn’t go
for teef dem horse, but dere was a gal back dere in Winchester
I was bound to see, and when I git dere de Yankee
tek my horse and I couldn’t git away again.” This excuse
served as well as any would have done.</p>

<p>Kershaw’s Division was sent back to reinforce Early, and
we went on to Richmond and thence to Swift Run, between
Richmond and Petersburg.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVII" id="XXVII">XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>General Anderson’s first visit was to General R. E. Lee,
who was at dinner, and insisted on our dining with him. It
was the most uncomfortable meal that I ever had in my
life. General Lee was fond of quizzing young officers, and
my frame of mind can be imagined when General Lee spoke
to me in this way: “Mr. Dawson, will you take some of
this bacon? I fear that it is not very good, but I trust that
you will excuse that. John! give Mr. Dawson some water;
I pray pardon me for giving you this cup. Our table service
is not as complete as it should be. May I give you
some bread? I fear it is not well baked, but I hope you
will not mind that,” &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; while my cheeks were
red and my ears were tingling, and I wished myself anywhere
else than at General Lee’s head-quarters.</p>

<p>On September 28th, General Anderson was ordered to
move to the North side of the James River and assume
command there. Early the next morning he and his staff
and couriers set out for Chaffin’s Bluff. We had ridden
some miles when a courier came up in a condition of desperate
excitement, and told us that the enemy in great force
had attacked the works on the North side of the river, near
Chaffin’s Bluff, had captured Battery Harrison, and were
probably by this time in Richmond. Sending him on to
General Lee’s head-quarters, we put spurs to our horses and
rode at a gallop to the river, where we crossed the pontoon
bridge and found the condition of affairs almost as bad as
had been described. Nothing but want of dash on the
part of the enemy had prevented them from taking Richmond.
The lines had been held by four or five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
men of our command, with a small number of the Home Guard
from Richmond, and when the enemy had taken Battery
Harrison the roads were open to them and they had nothing
to do but march right into the Confederate Capital. Fortunately
for us, they believed us to be much stronger
than we were and waited for reinforcements. Only one
hundred and fifty men occupied Battery Harrison when it was
attacked. In the afternoon Laws’ Brigade came to our assistance,
and with Gregg and Benning repulsed a desperate
attack made by the enemy on Battery Gilmer. Here we
saw that colored troops could be made to fight for one dash at
all events. They came right up to the fort very resolutely,
but, encountering an obstinate resistance, they gave way
completely and took refuge in the ditch, where they were
easily disposed of. It was just the sort of fight that any
one would like. Shells with the fuses cut to a half second
were thrown into the ditch and played havoc with the
terror-stricken negroes.</p>

<p>The next morning, September 30th, General Lee having
obtained reinforcements, an effort was made to retake
Battery Harrison. The attack was not well arranged
apparently, and failed completely. A new defensive line
was therefore taken up and fortified, and the enemy were
left to make the most of their barren conquest.</p>

<p>There was no fighting of much importance after this
until October 7th, when we made an attempt to turn the
enemy’s right and drive him back to the river. At first the
movement was completely successful and we captured nine
pieces of artillery and some prisoners, but when we struck
the enemy in position near the New Market Road we were
repulsed and General Gregg was killed. It was on this day,
unless I am mistaken, that, in a cavalry charge, Colonel A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
C. Haskell, of the Seventh S. C. Cavalry, was desperately
wounded, and for a time in the hands of the enemy.
Volunteers were called for to make a charge and recover
the body, and one of these volunteers was C. S. McCall, of
Bennettsville, who is now State Senator from Marlboro’
County, in this State, and as gallant a soldier and as good a
fellow as we had in the army. There was a touching incident
this day when Gregg’s Brigade had been repulsed and
Gregg had fallen mortally wounded. General Lee, with
General Anderson and a number of officers, was watching
the attack, when a boy apparently about eighteen or nineteen
years old, his uniform dabbled with blood and his arms
hanging limp by his sides, came up to General Lee, and
nodding to him said: “General! if you don’t send some
more men down there, our boys will get hurt sure.”
General Lee asked him if he was wounded. “Yes, sir,” he
replied. “Where are you wounded?” asked General Lee.
“I am shot through both arms, General; but I don’t mind
that General! I want you to send some more men down
there to help our boys.” General Lee told him that he
would attend to it, and directed one of his staff officers to
take charge of this poor boy and see that he was properly
cared for.</p>

<p>In a letter which I wrote to England about this time, I
gave the price of different articles in Confederate money:
a pair of cavalry boots $350; coffee $15 a pound; sugar $10
a pound; a linen collar $5; a pocket handkerchief $10;
Richmond papers 50 cents each; tobacco, which two years
before was 25 and 30 cents a pound, was selling at $8 or $9
a pound. For the making of a pair of trowsers I paid $100.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII">XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>A sudden and very welcome change in my position now
took place. I cannot say that my connection with General
Longstreet had been pleasant to me personally, for the
reason that he was disposed to be reserved himself, while
the principal members of his staff, with two exceptions, were
positively disagreeable. Colonel Sorrell, the Adjutant-General,
was bad tempered and inclined to be overbearing.
Colonel Fairfax was clownish and silly, and Major Walton,
whom I have mentioned before, was always supercilious.
Colonel Osman Latrobe was courteous enough at all times,
and Colonel Manning was exceedingly kind and considerate.
Besides Colonel Manning, I had not a friend on the staff.
The staff had “no use” for me, which was perhaps not surprising,
as I was a stranger and a foreigner, and I was on no
better terms with them in 1864 than I had been in 1862.
Still I had the satisfaction of knowing that I had a good reputation
in the army as an officer, and that it was known at
General Lee’s head-quarters that the whole responsibility in
the Ordnance Department of the corps rested upon me.
General Anderson had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General,
and was to take command of a corps at
Petersburg when General Longstreet should return to duty,
and he was kind enough to tell me that if Colonel Baldwin,
the Chief of Ordnance of the army, would consent to the
transfer, he would take me with him to Petersburg, and
make me Chief Ordnance Officer of his corps. This would
have given me the rank of Major or Lieutenant-Colonel. I
rode over to Petersburg to see Colonel Baldwin, and he told
me that he would be delighted to see me promoted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
would order the assignment to be made. Unfortunately,
though properly, General Anderson, upon reflection, came
to the conclusion that it would not be just to Captain E. N.
Thurston, who had been his Ordnance Officer while he was in
command of a division, to promote me over his head, and
that he ought to make Captain Thurston his Chief Ordnance
Officer. I assented, of course, but was determined to seize
any opportunity that offered to leave Longstreet’s Corps.
As far back, indeed, as the month of June I had made a
written application to be relieved from duty with the command.
The opportunity came when I least expected it.
General Fitzhugh Lee, a nephew of General R. E. Lee,
while in the command of the cavalry in the Valley of Virginia
had lost his Ordnance Officer, Captain Isaac Walke,
of Norfolk, Virginia, who was killed in action, to the deep
regret of his comrades. Through some kind friend General
Lee heard of me. It seems that he had told Colonel
Baldwin and others that he wanted an officer to take Captain
Walke’s place, who was both “a good officer and a gentleman.”
To my great pleasure I was recommended to him.
He made application for me, and I was relieved from duty
with Longstreet’s Corps and directed to report to General
Fitz Lee at Richmond. This was in November, 1864.</p>

<p>General Longstreet had already resumed command of the
1st Corps, and I have not seen him since I took leave of him
before I went to join Fitz Lee. The reputation that Longstreet
had as a fighting man was unquestionably deserved, and
when in action there was no lack of energy or of quickness
of perception, but he was somewhat sluggish by nature, and
I saw nothing in him at any time to make me believe that
his capacity went beyond the power to conduct a square
hard fight. The power of combination he did not possess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and whenever he had an independent command he was unsuccessful.
A better officer to execute a prescribed movement,
and make such variations in it as the exigencies of
the battle required, would be hard to find, but he needed
always a superior mind to plan the campaign and fix the
order of battle. It should be said of Longstreet, especially
in view of his political course since the war, that he never
faltered or hesitated in his devotion to the Confederate
cause. A stauncher soldier the South did not have, and at
Appomattox, when hope was gone, and General Lee, to
prevent the useless loss of blood, was prepared to surrender,
Longstreet pleaded for permission to take the remnant of
his men and endeavor to cut his way through the surrounding
enemy. But Longstreet was a soldier, and nothing else.
Of the principles that underlay secession he knew nothing,
and when we were defeated, and the war was over, he
considered that might had made the North right, and
that he could, without any impropriety, go over to the
victors. The whirligig of time brought its revenges, however,
when Longstreet, at the head of the Metropolitan
Police in New Orleans, endeavoring to maintain, by armed
force, the political supremacy of the “carpet-baggers,” was
confronted and routed by the old soldiers of his corps,
whom he had again and again led to victory in Virginia.
They spared him in remembrance of what he had been, but
they drove his Metropolitan Police like rabbits before them.</p>

<p>I have come across a note written by Mr. Frank Vizetelly,
of the <cite>Illustrated London News</cite>, in 1864, in response to enquiries
of one of my relatives in London, where Mr.
Vizetelly then was. I give what he says, as the testimony
of one who knew me while I was with Longstreet. The
note is as follows: “Will you tell your friend that I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Lieutenant Dawson very well indeed. He is Ordnance
Officer to General Longstreet, and when I left the Confederacy,
at the end of January, he was quite well. He is very
much liked, and is a very good officer, and, I have no doubt,
will make his way.” I should like to quote here also what
was said by the Richmond <cite>Examiner</cite>, in 1863, about the
Englishmen then in the Confederacy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">ENGLISHMEN IN OUR SERVICE.</p>

<p>Wherever and whenever a war for freedom is given, there Englishmen will
be found, not for glory only, but for the natural bull-dog love of fighting and
the inborn British love of the just cause and the weak side. Thus we find on
the side of Yankee tyranny but one Englishman, Sir Percy Wyndham, who has
lately quitted the Lincolnites in disgust; while on our side we find Colonel
Grenfell still firm in his affection for the Stars and Bars; Captain Byrne, who
lost a leg at Manassas, and insists upon fighting through the war; Captain
Gordon of A. P. Hill’s staff, who acted so gallantly at Fredericksburg; and
many others, in both our Army and Navy. Among these “others” the name
of Lieutenant Dawson deserves mention. Lieutenant D., a youth of eighteen
or nineteen, insisted on coming over in the <i>Nashville</i>. Captain Pegram’s sense
of duty would not permit him to receive him as a passenger, so he shipped before
the mast as a common sailor, and in that capacity did his duty faithfully
and manfully. Arrived in this city, he at once joined the Purcell Battery as a
private, and was wounded in one of the battles on the Chickahominy. As soon
as his wound was well, General Randolph very justly promoted him to a Lieutenancy,
which post he continues to fill with distinction and credit to the service.
We bid him and the rest of his Anglo-Confederate comrades God speed,
good luck, and plenty of promotion, for they are sure to deserve it. And if
they are disposed to settle down in Dixie, we have no objection to their forming
an alliance with some of our pretty Southern girls.</p></div>

<p>It was on November 10, 1864, that General Fitz Lee applied
for me, and in a letter written to my mother at the time I
said that General Longstreet was very reluctant to give me
up. I must say that he did not show any particular interest
in retaining me as long as no one else wanted me. General
Fitz Lee was in Richmond, having been wounded in the
Valley. I reported to him, and was then directed to go to
Harrisonburg, Va., and report to General T. L. Rosser, who
was then in command of General Lee’s Division. I found that
the head-quarters were near Harrisonburg, and was made
most cordially welcome there. Lieutenant Charles Minnigerode,
son of Dr. Minnigerode, of Richmond, was aide-de-camp
to General Lee, and he and I took a great fancy to
each other immediately. The other officers of the staff
were Major Robert M. Mason, Chief Quarter-master and
acting Inspector-General of the Division; Major W. B.
Warwick, of Richmond, Chief Commissary; Dr. Archie
Randolph, Medical Director. Major J. Du Gué Ferguson,
of Charleston, the Adjutant-General of the Division, had
been taken prisoner, and was not with the command.
Major Bowie, the Inspector-General, had been wounded at
Spotsylvania, and did not rejoin the division. A better set
of fellows than Fitz Lee’s staff it would have been difficult
to find. They formed in truth, according to the old phrase,
the military family of General Lee. There was no bickering,
no jealousy, no antagonism. We lived together as
though we were near relatives, and I have the fondest and
truest affection for every one of them. Major Mason is a
first cousin of General Fitz Lee, and I have not seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
for several years. Archie Randolph I have not heard of
since the war ended. Minnigerode was the last man
wounded in the Army of Northern Virginia. He was
struck near the spine by a rifle ball while riding along the
lines to give the order to cease firing, when the last flag of
truce had been displayed at Appomattox. For many
months he was paralyzed, but he has now entirely recovered,
and when I last heard of him he was living in New Orleans.</p>

<p>I found that it was no joke to organize the Ordnance
Department of a couple of divisions of Confederate cavalry,
but I adapted myself to circumstances, and, having some
good assistants, was able to get everything in tolerably
good order. We then set out on a raid into Hardy County,
West Virginia, for the purpose of capturing horses and
cattle. The command, under the leadership of General
Rosser, had made a week or two before a very successful
raid upon New Creek, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
They had captured the place and brought off a vast quantity
of stores of different descriptions. The present raid was
not so eventful. I had not known what cold was before
this. The snow lay on the ground a foot deep, and the
wind was so keen and bitter that it was difficult to face it.
For miles the road lay on a narrow ledge, the mountain
rising like a wall on the right, while on the left there was a
nearly perpendicular fall of six hundred feet to the Valley
below, where a brook, held in icy chains, was shining in the
sun. One slip would have sent horse and rider headlong to
the bottom of the precipice. Through such scenes as this
we rode for a week without any serious accident. Right in
the midst of the mountains we came upon the charming
residence of Mr. Cunningham, who was living in a manner
that seemed entirely out of keeping with the wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
around him. In his house there was every comfort, with
many a luxury that in the Confederacy we had almost
forgotten. Miss Annie Cunningham was one of the prettiest
women I have ever seen, and became at once the centre of
attraction with our young officers. With sleighing parties
during the day and singing and dancing at night, our short
stay in Hardy County was inexpressibly pleasant. After
we left them, as the spokesman of the enamored staff, and
not speaking in any sense for myself, I wrote a passionate
epistle to Miss Annie, which was entrusted to one of our
scouts for delivery. In it I put all the pretty phrases which
were suggested by the occasion and the object. Unluckily
for me, the note did not reach the fair Annie, but fell into
the hands of the Yankees, and was published afterwards in
one of the Baltimore papers as a specimen Confederate
love letter.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of talk at head-quarters about
Captain Charles Cavendish, who reported to General Fitz
Lee for duty at, or about, the time that General J. E. B.
Stuart was killed, at Yellow Tavern, and who was now
absent on leave. Cavendish represented himself to be a
cousin of the Duke of Devonshire, and said he held a commission
in the 18th Hussars. I knew him quite well later
on, and it is indubitable that he was a thorough soldier.
General Fitz Lee told me that just when Cavendish reported
to him the enemy were attacking in force, and one
of our regiments was ordered to charge. Cavendish was
well mounted and handsomely equipped, and asked General
Lee’s permission to go in with the regiment. This permission
was at once given, and Cavendish rode off. Ten
minutes later he returned with his saddle on his head, saying
that “a blasted Yankee had fired at him from behind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tree and killed his horse.” This was a fact. Cavendish,
however, shot the Yankee. There was some things about
Cavendish that our fellows could not understand. Riding
through the woods one day, he tore the leg of his trousers,
and a bare red leg was plainly visible. Minnigerode expressed
his surprise at the sight, when Cavendish bluntly
informed him that in England gentlemen never wore
drawers. The matter was referred to me for decision, and
I was unable to confirm what Cavendish had said. It is the
fact, however, I think, that the privates and non-commissioned
officers in the crack cavalry regiments in England
wear nothing but the trousers, in order to secure a closer
and better fit. Cavendish remained with us for some time,
and in Richmond led a very wild life. As usual in such
cases, he became short of money, and his drafts on his
noble relatives in England were freely discounted. Cavendish
went away, and the drafts came back dishonored.
Inquiries were then made about him in England, and it
was ascertained that he was most inappropriately named
Short, and that he had been a corporal or sergeant in one
of the English cavalry regiments. Cavendish was punctilious,
however, in the discharge of his duties at our head-quarters,
and paid his mess bills as promptly as any one else.</p>

<h2><a name="XXX" id="XXX">XXX.</a></h2>


<p>After our return from Hardy County, bringing with us a
large drove of cattle, we established our head-quarters at a
railroad station, eight or ten miles beyond Staunton. General
Early was down the Valley, in the neighborhood of Harrisonburg,
and a large body of the enemy’s cavalry moved up
to attack him. They expected to make a raid on Gordonsville,
if they did not encounter Early. On the Monday before
Christmas day, 1864, we moved out from camp with our
division, and marched to Harrisonburg. It was desperately
cold, and the sleet froze as it fell. My hat by the evening
was as stiff as a board, and had a heavy fringe of icicles.
The horses were slipping and sliding at every step, and the
thirty miles seemed like fifty. We rested for a few hours
at Harrisonburg, and General Rosser ascertained where the
enemy’s cavalry, under Custer, were to encamp for the night.
At one o’clock in the morning we moved out again, the plan
being to go by devious paths to the neighborhood of Custer’s
camp, and there attack him at daybreak. Our whole
effective force did not exceed five or six hundred men. The
march was conducted with great judgment, and a little before
daybreak, with no alarm given, the division formed in
the woods on the edge of the open fields where, surrounded
by blazing fires of fence rails, Custer’s troopers lay. The
rattling of the sleet and the howling of the wind had effectually
concealed our movements; but the men were almost
stiff with cold, and it was hard to see how they would manage
to handle their carbines or sabres. Just before daybreak
the order to charge was given. I was with General
Rosser at the head of the column, and I shall never forget the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
astonishment of the Yankee sentinel, who, as our horses came
upon him like ghosts from the bosom of the darkness, fired
his carbine in the air, and cried out: “My God, where do
all those men come from!” It was a complete surprise,
and in ten minutes, and with very small loss to ourselves,
we had driven Custer and his entire command, consisting of
about 2,000 men, out of their camp, and sent them whirling
down the Valley. I was slightly wounded in the left leg,
but not disabled from duty. Custer was in a farm house
near by, and the story goes that, when he made his escape,
he was in the condition that Cavendish would have been in,
if he had lost his trousers entirely.</p>

<p>After the first dash, which, happily for us, accomplished
what was desired, our men were very hard to hold. Had
Custer attacked us, I do not think that we should have
stopped short of Staunton. Expecting a counter charge, I
tried, with General William H. Payne, (“Billy” Payne
of the Black Horse Cavalry) to rally some of our men
on the colors; but when I had gathered a dozen or two
together, and started after some more, the first squad
melted away into the woods. By common consent, the
whole command withdrew. Custer had gone off one way,
and our people had gone off quietly in the opposite direction.
No one remained but General Rosser, Minnigerode,
Mason, Archie Randolph and I. General Rosser suggested
that we might as well go on after Custer, and see what he
was doing, and we moved down the Turnpike, following
Custer’s rear-guard at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Three or four hundred yards away, on our right, coming
along a converging road, was a body of thirty or forty men.
They had their oil-cloths on, and it was difficult to tell who
they were; but I had an unpleasant conviction that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were Yankees. We were approaching fast the forks of the
road where we should meet them, and I ventured to suggest
to General Rosser that they were not our men, but he
insisted that they were not Yankees, and that, anyhow, we
had better go on and see. So we went on. We were not
more than a hundred yards away when the strangers halted,
and were evidently preparing to fire. The imperturbable
Rosser remarked very serenely: “Well, Dawson, you are
right, those fellows are Yankees, but there are not many of
them. Let’s charge them.” And we four did charge them;
and, to our amazement and relief, the Yankees put spurs to
their horses and galloped off down the Valley. As often
happens in war, audacity had saved us. Nothing would
have been easier than for those Yankees to have gathered
us in, for we were half frozen, and our horses were worn
out with hard riding.</p>

<p>We rode back to Harrisonburg, and having accomplished
what was desired, and given General Early time to withdraw
his wounded and stores, we retired to Staunton. There we
were soon joined by General Fitz Lee.</p>

<p>Staunton is a hospitable place, and few days passed without
an invitation to a dinner or a dancing party. I realized
completely the delightful difference between my position
with Longstreet, and my position with General Lee. By
General Lee we were treated always as if we were his
kinsmen, but, intimate and affectionate as our intercourse
was, no one of us could ever forget the respect due to his
rank. What we did for him, however, was just as much for
love as it was for military duty.</p>

<p>From Staunton, we now moved to Waynesboro’, where
there was much merry-making, and Minnigerode fell in love
again, and secured a provisional sweetheart. Soon we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
were hurried to Richmond to head off a raiding party of
the enemy.</p>

<p>One way and another I saw a good deal of General
Rosser, and to my mind, there were few officers in the service
who had as much military genius as he had. Instinctively,
he seemed to know what was best to do, and how to do
it. It appeared almost impossible to tire him, or to break
him down, and I have known him to ride day after day for
a couple of weeks with a running wound in his leg. Had
he had the unlimited command of horses and material that
the cavalry Generals on the other side had, we should have
known little peace in the Confederacy. Unfortunately,
however, there was something lacking in Rosser’s character,
which I can best express, perhaps, by repeating a warning
which was given me soon after I joined the command. It
was this: One of my fellow officers said to me, “If Rosser
gives you any order to deliver for the movements of troops
in action, be careful to get that order in writing, and then,
if anything goes wrong in consequence of the order, it
cannot be said that the fault is yours.”</p>

<h2><a name="XXXI" id="XXXI">XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>We camped below Richmond, and I obtained leave of
absence to go to Boydton for a few days, and from Boydton
I crossed over into North Carolina to make a visit to a
friend who was staying there. The Roanoke River was so
high that the ferryman was unwilling to cross; but by the
payment of $250 in Confederate money I succeeded in inducing
him to take me over. It was a foolish performance,
as the chances were ten to one that we should not be able
to make a landing on the other side. From North Carolina
I then went to Stony Creek, where I was told that our
division was. This little railroad station, which had looked
when I first saw it, in 1862, as if it were not visited by ten
persons in a month, was now a busy military post, several
thousand Confederates being encamped around it. Finding
that I had been misinformed, I hurried by a circuitous route
to Richmond, the enemy having possession of the railroad
between Stony Creek and Petersburg. I reported for duty
just as the division was on the march from Richmond.
Through Powhatan County we rode, and, as ours was the
first large body of troops that had passed through that
happy place, the scenes of the early months of the war were
repeated, to the satisfaction and surprise of our men.
Ladies came out to the roadside with cakes and sandwiches
and milk, and our people enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
It is true that there were rather more of us than even the
hospitable people of Powhatan could accommodate. The
ladies there were very much in the plight of a good woman
to whose house I went in the first Maryland campaign. I
rode up to ask for a glass of water, and, before I had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
what I wanted, was told that I really could not get breakfast,
as there was nothing left in the house. The kind soul
told me that she had made up her mind, when she heard
that General Lee’s army was coming, to give every one of
his soldiers something to eat, and, when she had stripped the
smoke-house bare, and used up every dust of meal, she was
warned that only one division of the army had gone by.
Then she gave up her generous purpose in something very
much like despair.</p>

<p>This time we did not strike the enemy, as expected, and
returned to Richmond, stopping for a day in Powhatan, at
the house of Mr. Harris, the brother of Major Harris, who
was Beauregard’s Engineer Officer at Charleston, and who
planned the more important defences around that City.
From Richmond we rode to Petersburg, and General Fitz
Lee was placed in command of the cavalry corps of the
Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of three divisions.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXII" id="XXXII">XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>The end was now very near. On March 30th, 1865, we
dined at Mrs. Cameron’s, in Petersburg, and rode out late
in the evening to overtake the command, which had gone
towards Five Forks. The greater part of the night we were
in the saddle, and what rest I had was on a couple of fence
rails in a corn field. It was raining heavily. Early in the
morning of March 31, our line was formed at Five Forks, as
it is called, a place where five roads meet. A blacksmith’s
shop that was there furnished, when pulled down, excellent
material for a breast-work. One of our servants came up
and made some coffee for us, and those who know how hot
poor coffee, in a tin cup, can be, will understand what our
feelings were when the cavalry of the enemy drove in our
pickets just as we were about to enjoy the refreshing
draught. We did not wait for the cavalry, and we took our
coffee with us. Later in the morning the enemy, supported
by infantry, attacked us in force. Our men were fighting
dismounted, and at first were driven back in some confusion.
General Payne was severely wounded, and I had just time
to shake hands with him as he was taken to the rear. I
did not see him again until the next year, when he was living
quietly at his own home, at Warrenton. It was very
difficult to rally the men. For the moment they were
completely demoralized. One fellow whom I halted as he
was running to the rear, and whom I threatened to shoot if
he did not stop, looked up in my face in the most astonished
manner, and, raising his carbine at an angle of forty-five
degrees, fired it in the air, or at the tops of the pines,
and resumed his flight. It made me laugh, angry as I was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
There was only one thing to do, and that was to order a
charge all along the line. The bugles sounded, and the
very men whom it had been impossible to stop a few
minutes before turned and attacked the enemy with an
impetuosity that bore everything before it. The difficulty
was, indeed, to keep the men from going too far. Their
blood was up; they were mortified that they should have
been thrown into confusion; and there was much trouble
in preventing them from running right in upon the main
body of the enemy.</p>

<p>There was a pause now in the operations, and General
Pickett had joined us with his division of infantry. My
dear old friend, Willie Pegram, who was by this time
Colonel of artillery, was there with a part of his battalion.
It was a great happiness to me to clasp his true hand again.
The next day he was slain&mdash;dying, as he had hoped and
prayed that he might, when the last hope of the Confederacy
was gone. This pure, sweet, brave man, a type of the
unaffected Christian soldier, remained on his horse when the
Federal infantry poured in over our works, and fell to the
ground mortally wounded, at the very end of the fight.
To Gordon McCabe, his Adjutant, who was with him then,
he spoke his last words: “I have done what I could for my
country, and now I turn to my God.”</p>

<p>Towards evening a desperate charge was made by W. H.
F. Lee’s Division, in which we lost heavily. The movement
was taken up by the divisions in the centre and on the left,
and we broke the enemy’s infantry and scattered them like
chaff before us. I flattered myself that my usual good luck
would attend me, for, as I rode abreast of the line and bowed
my head in passing under a tree, the bough which I had
stooped to escape was struck sharply by a rifle ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
But only two or three minutes afterward I was shot squarely
in the arm, near the shoulder, and put <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.
Archie Randolph was by me in a minute, and poured an
indefinite quantity of apple brandy down my throat. This
revived me, and, with my arm in a sling, I rode back to
where General Fitz Lee was, only to be ordered peremptorily,
for my pains, to return instantly to head-quarters.
Keith Armistead, the son of General Armistead who was
killed at Gettysburg, was one of our couriers, and he went
back with me. That night an ineffectual effort was made
by our surgeons to find the ball, which was supposed to be
near the shoulder. General Lee insisted that I should go
back to Petersburg or Richmond, as I preferred. Soon
after daybreak I was told that the enemy had broken our
lines at Petersburg, and I could not return to that place; so
I went to Richmond, where I arrived on Sunday night,
April 2.</p>

<p>Major Warwick had begged that I would go to the house
of his father, Major Abram Warwick, and I had the satisfaction
of letting him know that his son was safe. Under the
influence of morphine I went to sleep, notwithstanding the
pain of my wound; and when I awoke in the morning Richmond
had been evacuated by the Confederates, and the
enemy were in possession of the city. The Warwicks had
known when I arrived that our troops were about to leave
Richmond, but had refrained from telling me, as they deemed
it unsafe to have me moved in the condition in which I
was. It was a sad, sad time. Mrs. W. B. Warwick walked
up and down the long halls almost demented with grief;
and there were other troubles besides those that grew out
of the hazardous condition of the soldiers who had retreated
with Lee. Two days before, Mr. Abram Warwick was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the wealthiest men in Richmond, and had almost unlimited
means at his command. This Monday morning the
great Gallego Mills, of which he was the principal owner,
lay in ashes, and he himself was without a dollar of money
that would pass current in the city. So it was on every
side. Hundreds of families were reduced to absolute beggary
by the fire which swept over Richmond. I cannot
bear to dwell upon the harrowing scenes of those days.
The surgeons made another effort to extract the ball from
my shoulder, and came to the wise conclusion that less harm
probably would be done by letting it alone than by cutting
and carving me in the effort to get it out. So they let me
alone, and that ball has never troubled me since.</p>

<p>A week after I reached Richmond I felt strong enough to
join the army again, although, of course, I could not use my
arm; and Miss Agnes Lee, one of General R. E. Lee’s
daughters, had arranged that I should be smuggled out of
the city, under a bale of hay, in one of the market carts that
came into the city with vegetables every morning. Then
came the harrowing tidings that General Lee had surrendered.
It seemed to us impossible that the Army of Northern
Virginia should be no more, and we scouted the first reports
that reached us. All too soon, however, General Lee came
back to Richmond, and there was no longer room for doubt.
The first returning officer whom I knew well was Colonel
Manning, who, with the big tears rolling down his checks,
as he sat gaunt and weary on his horse in Franklin Street,
told me the pitiful story of the last days of the army and
the circumstances of the surrender. The only consolation
to me was that General Fitz Lee and my dear comrades had
escaped unhurt, except Minnigerode, who was wounded and
in the hands of the enemy, as mentioned previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing in the behaviour of the Federal troops
to mitigate the unpleasantness of our situation. They did
not rob, and they did not kill; but they sought opportunities
to humiliate and annoy the defeated Confederates. One
of their first orders was that no person should wear clothing
with military buttons; and those who had no other buttons
but military buttons must cover them so as to conceal their
character. After this, the buttons on most of our uniforms,
which were the only clothing we had, were covered with
crape.</p>

<p>I had lost my desk containing my commissions and papers,
which I had left in our head-quarters wagon; but Armistead
had put my trunk in the ambulance, and I saved that.
Armistead went back to the command as soon as he had
placed me in Mr. Warwick’s care; and, as he was but poorly
armed, I gave him my revolver, which thus was saved from
falling into the hands of the enemy. My sabre, which was
taken from me on the night that I was wounded, was unfortunately
left at head-quarters, and was lost.</p>

<p>The war being virtually at an end, and there being no
other way to get out of Richmond, I presented myself to
the Provost Marshal and was duly paroled. Then I went
over to Petersburg, my whole worldly possessions being a
postage stamp and what was left of a five dollar greenback
that a friend in Baltimore had sent me. The first thing I
did with this greenback, by the way, was to get small change
for it so as to make it look big; and the first luxuries that I
bought were cigars and oranges.</p>

<p>I went to Petersburg on April 23d. At Petersburg I was invited
to make a visit to Mr. William Cameron, and was very
glad to accept. All his servants had left him, and Colonel
Frank Huger, of the artillery, and I amused ourselves by preparing
the table for breakfast and dinner, and were Mrs.
Cameron’s chief assistants in cutting vegetables in the garden
and in washing up the dishes. I must say that this last
process was anything but advantageous, as we contrived
between us to break a good deal of our friend’s pretty china
and delicate glass. The unfortunate things had a horrible
way of losing their handles and of coming to pieces, as we
scrubbed them with more zeal than discretion.</p>

<p>Early in June, I went to Mechlenburg to see Mr. Raines,
who was still living on the plantation which he had rented
near the plantation of Dr. Jones; and it was then that I
heard of the barbarous conduct of the Federal cavalry on
their raid through that neighborhood, and which I have
mentioned previously. This raid it will be remembered
was made after the surrender of General Lee’s army, and
when there was no shadow of military justification or excuse
for it. Little was wanting to make the conduct of the
soldiers utterly execrable, and Dr. Jones escaped better than
most of his neighbors. By this time the health of Mrs. Jones
was exceedingly feeble, and in the September following she
died. Meanwhile, the seeds of consumption were developed
in her younger sister, Miss Martha Raines, and she too died
a few months afterwards. Consumption also carried off the
only remaining sister, Miss Anna Raines, who died, I think,
in 1866.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>It was rather difficult for me to get back from Mechlenburg
to Petersburg, a distance of about one hundred miles;
but I borrowed an old horse, and, out of the remains of
several old buggies and carriages that were on the place,
succeeded in making up what appeared to be a rather respectable
vehicle. It did hang together pretty well until I
had occasion to cross a river on my route, when the action
of the water caused one of the wheels to fall to pieces in
the middle of the stream. With considerable difficulty, I
dragged what remained of the buggy out of the river, and
was fortunate enough to be able to borrow another wheel
from a planter near by. The wheel that I borrowed I was
to return to him when I should go back to Mechlenburg.
As I never went back, the wheel, I grieve to say, was not
returned; and, as I do not know the name of my kind friend,
it would be vain to try to compensate him for the loss he
sustained. What weighs, I think, rather more heavily than
this on my conscience, is a commission entrusted to me by
an old farmer, on the road, with whom I took supper one
night. Finding that I expected to come back in a few days,
he asked me if I would bring him a Richmond newspaper,
and gave me a silver dime to pay for it. That dime he had
saved during the war, and only parted with it from a desire to
get some news of what was going on. No doubt he, and
the friend who lent me the buggy wheel, think of me to-day
as one of the gay deceivers who were abundant after the
cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>While still a good many miles from Petersburg, what with
insufficient food and hard driving my horse broke down
completely, and I dragged along the rest of the way at the
rate of a mile or two an hour. Near Petersburg I stopped
to dine with a planter, who, finding that I was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Englishman, asked me how far it was from London to
Windsor. I told him, and he replied that the distance
could not be so great, for he remembered an anecdote of
the singular experience of one of the sentries at Windsor
Castle, who was accused of sleeping on his post. Denying
this emphatically, the sentry told the officers that he had
heard the bell of St. Paul’s, at London, strike at midnight.
This was thought to be impossible; but he told them that he
not only heard it, but that the bell struck thirteen instead of
twelve. It was afterward ascertained that, through some
derangement of the machinery of the clock, thirteen had
been struck instead of twelve, and the vigilance of the sentry
was established. I do not know what the origin of the
anecdote was, but it was curious to meet with it in the
bosom of Virginia. And this reminds me of the quaint
knowledge of things in London that I found here and there
in the South. Mr. L. M. Blackford, who was attached to
the Military Court of Longstreet’s Corps, asked me one day
as we were riding along the road, what streets I would take
if I wanted to go from one part of London, which he named,
to another part. I told him, and he said he thought it
would be nearer to take other streets than those I had mentioned.
I asked him if he had been to London. He said
that he had not, but explained that his father and himself
were so much attached to England, and to everything
English, that they had studied the map of London, and were
almost as familiar with the place, by the map, as if they had
lived there. Mr. Blackford, by the way, is now the Principal
of the Episcopal High School at Alexandria, Va. I have
not seen him since the war, but know that he has been to
Europe, and has, therefore, had an opportunity of putting
his knowledge of London streets to good account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>My efforts to obtain employment in Petersburg were entirely
unsuccessful, although I was not particular about the
kind of work. I was on the point of getting an engagement
as the driver of a dray, but a stalwart negro, at the last
moment, was taken in my place. It was a sensible thing on
the part of the employer of the negro, no doubt, but it was
mortifying to me that a negro should be allowed to earn his
bread, and a white man, who was willing to do the same
work, be denied the opportunity.</p>

<p>In July I went over to Richmond, and with a Mr. Evans,
(a relative of Mr. Tyler) began arrangements for publishing
a small weekly newspaper. My work was to be local
reporting and canvassing for advertisements. The type, I
think, was borrowed from the Richmond <cite>Whig</cite>, and we got
to the point of making up one form, consisting of the first
and fourth pages of the forthcoming paper. But the <cite>Whig</cite>
had done something to offend the military autocrat who was
in command at Richmond, and one fine morning he sent a
party of soldiers to the <cite>Whig</cite> office, who took possession
of the whole establishment, and closed it up. Our newspaper
in embryo was embargoed with the rest of the establishment,
and there my first connection with American
journalism came to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Returning to Petersburg, I walked down to Mr. Raines’
plantation, and there earned something for myself, for the
first time since the war had ended. Mr. Raines had returned
home, and had cut his wheat crop, which was a very fine
one, and, as much to amuse us as anything else, he told
his son Frank and me that, if we would take the horse-rake
and glean the fields, we might have what wheat we could
find. It was desperately hot work, but we succeeded in
getting a considerable quantity of wheat, which Mr. Raines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
threshed out and sold for us in Petersburg. My share
of the proceeds was about $10.</p>

<p>I spoke just now of walking down to the plantation. The
distance from Petersburg was about eighteen miles, and I
frequently walked it by the middle of the day, leaving
Petersburg early in the morning.</p>

<p>One of the Ordnance Sergeants of Longstreet’s Corps,
John J. Campbell, lived at Petersburg, and I stayed there
with him for some time, after my visit to Mr. Cameron.
Mrs. Campbell was a plain, unaffected and thoroughly good-hearted
woman, and was unremitting in her kindness. Unfortunately
there came to be more talking than I liked about
my own affairs, and a coolness grew up which I greatly regretted.
I mention Mrs. Campbell here, in order to have
the satisfaction of showing that, whatever was the cause of
the discontinuance of our friendly relations, I am, and
always have been, most grateful for her kindness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Andrew White had been zealous in her efforts to
secure for me some employment, and to her I was indebted
for the clothes which took the place of my Confederate
uniform. Through her instrumentality, in October I was
engaged by Seldner &amp; Rosenberg, of Petersburg, as book-keeper.
I fear that I knew nothing, or next to nothing,
about book-keeping. But my employers were not aware of
that awkward fact, and I do not think that they discovered
it. The pay was $40 a month, and I paid $30 a month for
my board. I went to work at half-past six o’clock in the
morning, and remained at work until eight o’clock at night.
There was not much margin for my personal expenses, and
the long hours made the occupation terribly irksome to me,
but I had the promise of an advance of pay, and, with that
before me, struggled on until November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>In Petersburg one day I saw a Federal officer riding my
black horse, which I had sent to Mr. Raines’ to recruit during
the previous winter, and which had been captured in
the raid there after the cessation of hostilities. I claimed
the horse at once, and the first difficulty I encountered was
the fact that I was not regarded as a citizen of the United
States. The officer in command at Petersburg told me that
my claim would not be considered, unless I could show that
I was an American citizen, or intended to become one. As
a matter of fact, I had become a citizen of Virginia, by my
service in the Confederate Army. But this was not
sufficient for the captors of my charger, so I made no difficulty
in fully renouncing before the proper officer at
Petersburg my allegiance to every foreign King, Prince or
potentate, and more particularly Her Majesty, Queen
Victoria. This was my formal “declaration of intention”
to become a citizen of the United States, and I received my
naturalization papers from Judge Bryan, of the United
States District Court, at Charleston, in 1867.</p>

<p>In spite of the greatest economy, I found that my expenses
were greater than my income, and I determined to
abandon book-keeping in the clothing and dry goods establishment
of Seldner &amp; Rosenberg, and try my hand at
planting, with Dr. Jones. The understanding with him was
that I should assist in managing the plantation under his
direction, and receive a portion of the net profit, whatever
that might be.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIV" id="XXXIV">XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>I closed up my affairs in Petersburg just as the week was
drawing to an end, and decided to go to Mechlenburg on
Monday morning; but I could not make up my mind to go
off without running over to Richmond to bid the Tylers
and other friends there good-bye. When I went into Mr.
Tyler’s house, where, as ever, my reception was most hearty,
Dr. C. W. Brock, Mr. Tyler’s son-in-law, asked me whether
I had received a telegram he had sent me. I told him that
I had not, and he then informed me, to my astonishment,
that Mr. H. Rives Pollard, who had been one of the editors of
the <cite>Examiner</cite> during the war, was about to resume the
publication of that paper, and wanted me to take a place
on the staff, as local reporter. I was in much the same
mood that I was in when I received my commission as
Ordnance Officer, in 1862, and told Brock that I knew nothing
about local reporting. But he insisted that it was too
good an opportunity to lose, and that I must close with
Pollard at once, and trust to work and luck for the rest.
Pollard was quite cordial, and told me that he would give
me $20 a week. This change from $40 a month to $80 a
month gave me a feeling of wealth that I am sure I have
never had since. It seemed to me that there were no
bounds to the results that might be accomplished with so
vast a sum. Pollard had issued a flaming prospectus, in
which he described the different members of the staff. As
I was unknown to journalistic fame I did not appear on the
roll. One of the conspicuous figures, however, was Mr.
B. R. Riordan, who, in the words of the prospectus, was an
“experienced and accomplished young journalist, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
been for a number of years one of the editors of the New
Orleans <cite>Delta</cite>, and who, during the war, had been the managing
editor of the Charleston <cite>Mercury</cite>.” Those were the
words, or very nearly so, and I was profoundly impressed,
I remember, with the journalistic grandeur of the forthcoming
journalist from the South. Pollard was busily engaged
in his room, and had refused to see any one, when a rather
slender and exceedingly quiet looking man came in, and
told me that he wanted to see Mr. Pollard. I told him that
Pollard was engaged, and could not be disturbed, whereupon
he told me, very composedly, that he expected that Mr.
Pollard would see him, and, without more ado, passed by
me and walked into Pollard’s room. This was my first introduction
to Mr. B. R. Riordan.</p>

<p>Pollard was a queer character: not without ability, but
lazy, vain and dissolute, and it was not very easy, therefore,
to make the <cite>Examiner</cite> what he wanted it to be. Under the
editorial management of Mr. John Daniel during the war,
the <cite>Examiner</cite> was known everywhere for its great ability
and its caustic criticisms of the conduct of the war by Mr.
Davis and his Cabinet. It was a brilliant newspaper, but
disfigured by the whim of Mr. Daniel that the old English
form of spelling words ending in “c” should be retained,
so that in the <cite>Examiner</cite> such words as “antic,” “critic,” and
“music,” were spelled with a final k. Pollard insisted
upon retaining this peculiarity. But this did not make up
for the loss of the brain and vigor of Mr. Daniel. Professor
Gildersleeve, of the University of Virginia, and other
erudite men, were engaged as editorial writers, but they did
not live in Richmond, and their work was often stale.
Pollard hacked and cooked their articles to suit himself,
and, when the supply of new material failed, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
no hesitation in revamping and republishing articles which
had appeared in the <cite>Examiner</cite> during the war. However,
I had no reason to complain of Pollard’s treatment of me.
Amongst other things, he was always exceedingly anxious
to resent any affront that might be put upon him, and this
weakness, if such it should be called, enabled me to make
myself indispensable. I occupied the unpleasant position, as
I should now consider it, of adviser and best man for Pollard
in his principal rencontres.</p>

<p>The first of these grew out of an article in the Richmond
<cite>Enquirer</cite> which reflected on the <cite>Examiner</cite>, and caused
Pollard to determine to cowhide the editor of the <cite>Enquirer</cite>
as soon as he could find him. When we ran the <cite>Enquirer</cite>
man to earth, he was in the hall of the House of Representatives
at the Capitol, and Pollard waited for him in
the rotunda. When the <cite>Enquirer</cite> man came out, Pollard
attempted to strike him and was resisted. Both the
<cite>Enquirer</cite> man and Pollard drew pistols, and several shots
were exchanged. Only one shot, however, took effect, and
it unfortunately carried away the tassel of the cane on
Houdon’s statue of George Washington, which is in the
centre of the rotunda. The combatants were arrested, and
for a few days there was peace.</p>

<p>The next offender was E. P. Brooks, of the New York
<cite>Times</cite>. In a letter from Richmond he spoke rather abusively
of Pollard, and Pollard decided to give him a beating. It
was not very easy to find him at first, as neither Pollard
nor I had ever seen him. After a long hunt I was told that
he was in the billiard room at the Spotswood Hotel, and I
succeeded in getting a good look at him. Pollard came
down immediately, armed to the teeth and flourishing a big
cowhide, and, when Brooks came into the lobby of the hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
accosted him and asked whether he was the Richmond correspondent
of the New York <cite>Times</cite>. Brooks told him that
he was, and thereupon Pollard seized him by the collar and
began to thrash him soundly. Several persons attempted
to interfere, but I kept them off with my pistol until the
affair was at an end. Brooks had pulled a handful of hair
out of Pollard’s long beard, and Pollard had jammed Brooks’
head through the glass partition in front of the desk, and
had given him some hard blows besides. Pollard was not
in good society in Richmond, but the Brooks affair was
much enjoyed. When I told a drawing-room full of ladies
about it, they clapped their hands with joy that the “miserable
Yankee” should have been so well thrashed by the
Southerner.</p>

<p>The next cloud of war was on account of Mrs. Henningsen,
wife of General Henningsen, whom the <cite>Examiner</cite> had
spoken of as a “notorious” character. This was not to be
a street fight, but a regular duel according to the “Code.”
Pollard placed himself in my hands, and I had a mischievous
pleasure in telling him that General Henningsen, who had
demanded an apology for the insult offered his wife, was a
crack shot, and could hit the spots on a card at fifteen paces
with a duelling pistol, nine times out of ten. Pollard told
me, in some little trepidation, that he did not believe he could
hit a barn door at ten paces, and I warned him that it was
high time that he was practicing. Pollard evidently did not
hanker after a fight this time, and I succeeded in arranging
the matter amicably.</p>

<p>A little later somebody else trod on Pollard’s toes, and
he determined to “post” him. Preceded by a negro boy
bearing a paste pot and brush and a number of hand bills
or posters, denouncing the person to be posted as a liar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
coward, and a variety of other things, Pollard marched down
Main Street with a double-barrelled shotgun on his shoulder
and a huge revolver and bowie-knife in a belt around his
waist. There was no fight, and I am not sure that the man
who was posted was in Richmond.</p>

<p>I have said that Pollard was a man of loose character, and
he was very careless in the statements he made affecting
anyone’s reputation if he could, by the publication, make a
hit for his paper. Yet, strange to say, he was killed for an
offence which he did not commit himself, although he was
responsible for it. In 1867, the paper he was managing
(the <cite>Examiner</cite> having died previously) published a flaming
account of the elopement of a Miss Grant, of Richmond.
It was written up very elaborately, and highly spiced. It
was expected that trouble would come of it, but it was not
supposed that Pollard would be denied the chance to defend
himself. James Grant, the brother of the lady who was the
subject of the article in the <cite>Examiner</cite>, ensconced himself in
a room in a house which Pollard passed regularly every
morning. It was near his office. As Pollard passed by
the window of the room, Grant, who was hidden from sight,
shot Pollard down with a double-barrelled gun. He died
instantly, and without knowing who killed him. Grant was
tried for murder, and was acquitted. The feeling in Richmond
was very strong against Grant: not because he had
killed Pollard, but because he had not confronted him like
a man, and given him a chance for his life. All this was
long after I left Richmond.</p>

<p>Mr. Riordan and I were now on very good terms. We
slept in one of the rooms at the <cite>Examiner</cite> office, in which
we worked, and took our meals together at Zetelle’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>restaurant. I suppose I must have made a good impression
upon him, as I find the following in a letter to my mother,
dated January 11, 1866: “Our news editor, a gentleman of
ten or fifteen years experience in the newspaper business,
says that it is impossible that a man of my talent can remain
unemployed, and Pollard says he is delighted with
my fluency, style and indefatigable energy. Of course, I do
not place one particle of reliance in such remarks as these.
They are sincere, and I am grateful for them, but these
gentlemen cannot make me think so highly of myself as
they seem to think of me.” About this time Mr. Riordan,
the news editor just mentioned, broached to me a plan
for starting a cheap and popular newspaper in Charleston,
South Carolina. He said that the Charleston newspapers were
very slow and old fashioned, and that there was a fine field
for a new and bright paper. This he had thought for a
long time, but had not taken any steps to give the project
shape, because he had not found the right sort of man to
go into it with him. He was pleased to say that I was just
the man he was looking for, and that he was quite sure that
he and I could make the paper successful. The whole of
the details of the prospective newspaper were carefully discussed.
It is rather amusing to recall now Riordan’s remark
that the local reporting in Charleston need not give
us much trouble, as the policemen would drop in and tell
us about anything that happened. Another remark of
his was about in these words: “Of course you know, Dawson,
you could not do the editorial writing, but we could
engage a man to do that for us.” Riordan, like myself, had
no money, but thought that he had friends who would lend
us some; and this was the position of affairs when my connection
with the <cite>Examiner</cite> was suddenly suspended.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXV" id="XXXV">XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>The Federal officers in Richmond gave several public
dancing parties, or “Hops” as they were called, at the different
hotels, and desired that the Richmond ladies should
attend them. There was, of course, too much feeling against
the North at this time to permit anything of the sort, and
the only Richmond women who attended these “Hops”
were the wives and daughters of the present and prospective
office holders under the United States Government.
The newspapers were not invited to send reporters to the
“Hops,” but the <cite>Examiner</cite> managed always to have a man
there, and gave a highly colored report of them the morning
after the occurrence, describing and naming the Richmond
people who were there, and dressing up the whole account
in a style of mingled bitterness and ridicule. J. Marshall
Hanna, the principal local reporter for the <cite>Examiner</cite>, did
most of the work on these reports, and it was he, by the
way, who described the elopement of Miss Grant which had
so tragical consequences. The Federal officers were indignant
at the way in which their efforts at reconciliation were
treated by the <cite>Examiner</cite>, but another “Hop” was announced.
This was in March, 1866. We prepared ourselves for
a report that should out-Herod Herod. Hanna, Mr. Fred.
Daniel, and I were engaged on it, and we called into requisition
every apt quotation we could find in French and Italian,
as well as in English. The report being finished, I went
to a ball to which I had been invited, and did not return to
the office until near daylight. At the office door I found a
sentry, who halted me and refused to allow me to pass into
the building. To my astonishment I then learned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Federal Commandant at Richmond had taken possession
of the <cite>Examiner</cite> office, and had suspended its publication,
on account of the malignant and disloyal reports of the
famous Yankee “Hops.” It was with great difficulty that
I induced the guard to allow me to go up to my room for
more suitable attire. Riordan told me that he was at his
desk working quietly on his exchanges, when he heard a
dull tramp, tramp in the street, and then tramp, tramp on
the stairs, and then tramp, tramp in the outer room, and
the command “halt!” and the rattle of muskets on the
floor. By this time he began to think that something unusual
was happening, and was sure of it when an officer
entered the room and told him that he had orders to seize
the whole establishment, and that he and everyone else
connected with the paper must leave the place at once.
This arbitrary and lawless proceeding did not shock me
as much as it ought to have done, inasmuch as it held out
the promise of a holiday, which I knew I could pass delightfully
with my fair friends in Richmond; but the very day
that the <cite>Examiner</cite> was shut up the proprietors of the Richmond
<cite>Dispatch</cite> sent for me, and offered me a salary of $25
a week if I would go on the staff of that paper. Mr. Pollard
made no objection, and I went to work at once on the <cite>Dispatch</cite>.
The <cite>Examiner</cite> remained in possession of the military
authorities for about two weeks I think, and was only
released when a peremptory order to that end was given by
the President himself.</p>

<p>On the <cite>Dispatch</cite> I was legislative and local reporter, and
was handsomely treated. One of my colleagues was Captain
J. Innes Randolph, who had played that ’possum trick on
me at Bunker Hill, on the retreat from Gettysburg. Randolph
was a man of many accomplishments. He played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the piano and violin charmingly, was a skillful engineer,
a very capable lawyer, and wrote charmingly in both prose
and verse. “The Good Old Rebel” is one of his productions,
and his lines on the statue of Marshall, which
now stands in the Capitol Square, are worth remembering.
Randolph is the son of Lieutenant Randolph of the Navy,
who tweaked President Jackson’s nose, and has something
of his father’s temper. A more cranky and irritable fellow
is rarely met with. He lives in Baltimore, and is now on
the staff of the <cite>American</cite>. I have not seen him for several
years.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1866 that I was instrumental in
forming what I believe to have been the first of the Confederate
Memorial Associations in the Southern States.
This is the Hollywood Memorial Association, of Richmond.
In Hollywood Cemetery are interred fifteen thousand or
sixteen thousand Confederate soldiers, and in Oakwood
Cemetery are as many more. Their graves were entirely
uncared for, and I began in the <cite>Dispatch</cite> to agitate the
subject, with a view to forming an association which should
undertake to keep the graves in order, mark them suitably,
and erect a monument to our dead. The earliest fruit of it
was a suspension of business on the first Memorial day,
when hundreds of young men who had belonged to different
military organizations went out to Hollywood, accompanied
by ladies bearing flowers, and labored for several hours
with spade and hoe in rearranging the mounds over the
graves, and clearing away the rank growth of weeds. The
ladies of the Hollywood Association were most enthusiastic,
and I acted as their Secretary. Public meetings were held
in the Churches in furtherance of the objects of the Association,
and in June I addressed three meetings of ladies on
one day, at different places. One of these meetings was at
the Monumental Church, and about five hundred ladies were
present. There were two different plans. One was to level
the graves and erect a general monument; and the other
was to mark each one of the graves with a headstone bearing
either the name of the soldier who lay there, or a number
by which, on reference to the books of the Cemetery, the
name of the soldier could be known. I pleaded for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
plan that would keep each grave separate and distinct, and
would allow any father or mother, or sister or brother, from
the far South to know the identical spot where the bones
of their dear one lay, rather than that they should be shown
a vast open area and be told that somewhere within those
bounds their young hero lay buried. I was modest in those
days, and, when one of the ladies at the close of the meeting
told me that she wanted to kiss me for my speech, I blushed
and declined. As long as I was in Richmond I continued
to work actively for the Memorial Association, and, when I
left Richmond to come to Charleston, I received from the
President a letter, of which the following is a copy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, November 8, 1866.</p>

<p><em>My Dear Sir</em>&mdash;As the organ of the Hollywood Memorial Association, I desire
to express to you our grateful acknowledgment of your untiring efforts in
our behalf, and our sense of your valuable and disinterested services in advancing
our solemn and sacred purpose.</p>

<p>Your taste and ardor have been efficient in securing for us a large share of
general sympathy.</p>

<p>We sincerely regret to lose you from our counsels, but feel assured of your
continued sympathy and interest, as you may of our best wishes for your success
and happiness.</p>

<p>Be pleased to accept our acknowledgments, and with them the accompanying
slight memorial.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">I am, with high respect, your friend,</span><br />
<span class="padr2">N. MACFARLAND,</span><br />
<em>President H. M. A.</em><br />
</p>

<p>To Captain <span class="smcap">F. W. Dawson</span>.</p></div>

<p>The “slight memorial” of which Mrs. MacFarland speaks
is a set of studs and sleeve buttons of gold, with the Confederate
battle-flag in enamel on each one. I hope that my
children will prize these; not only because they bear upon
them the flag under which their father fought, but because
of the source whence they came, and the work and sympathy
they commemorate.</p>

<p>I had much to do with another undertaking of a totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
different character. My immediate circle of friends, among
the men in Richmond, consisted of Captain Philip H. Haxall,
who had been on General Lee’s staff for a short time;
Charlie Minnigerode, whom I have spoken of before, and
who was now fast recovering from his wound; Willie Myers,
who married a niece of Captain Pegram, Miss Mattie Paul,
and died of consumption, dear fellow, some years ago;
Page McCarty, who afterwards blighted his life by killing
Mordecai in a duel; Jack Elder, the artist; and John Dunlop,
my old Petersburg friend, and a few others. We had
been in the habit of meeting at night, when we had any
time to spare, in what we called “the chicken coop,” which
was a sort of summer-house in the rear of a restaurant in
Broad Street. Here we founded the Richmond Club, of
which Colonel D. G. MacIntosh, of South Carolina, who had
married the beautiful Virginia Pegram, and was then living
in Richmond, was the first President. I was the first Secretary.
I mention the Richmond Club here, because it soon
grew to be a large and prosperous concern, with a handsome
club house of its own, and because there were features in
the constitution and by-laws which might be adopted with
advantage by similar associations. Card-playing for money
was absolutely prohibited, and what was more peculiar than
this, and was a hobby of my own, no member was allowed
to take any refreshments whatever in the club at the expense
of another. No “treating” was permitted, unless a
stranger should have been invited to the club by a member,
in which case the member who invited him might ask other
friends to join the party. It was an admirable rule, and
was effectual in preventing that hard drinking which is the
bane of most clubs, and which is difficult, at times, to avoid
so long as one member feels under any obligation, or is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
permitted, to invite other members to drink with him at his
expense, which involves an obligation on their part to return
the compliment.</p>

<p>My health now was not as good as it had been. I was
attacked by chills and fever, and obliged to give up my
work. I think the malady was brought on by my exposure
to the sun, in my tramps about the streets in the summer.
Dr. Barney, of Richmond, insisted upon my going to his
house, and Mrs. Barney was assiduous in her kindness. As
soon as I began to regain my strength I went up to Mr.
Barton Haxall’s beautiful place, near Orange Courthouse,
and recovered rapidly. This was in August or September,
1866. I had for a short time been engaged to be married
to Miss Mary Haxall, one of Mr. Haxall’s daughters, but
was unceremoniously jilted not long before I went up to
Orange. A brighter or wittier girl than Mary Haxall, in
those days, it were hard to find; and the unkindest cut of all
was that she should have ended by marrying a man whom
she might never have known had I not presented him to
her. This is Mr. Alexander Cameron, a wealthy tobacco
manufacturer of Richmond, who is, I am told, desperately
in love with his wife after all these years, and proves his
affection by allowing her to have her own way in everything.
Before my engagement to her, I was at a party as her
escort, when Mr. George, of Richmond, appeared discourteous
in his conduct towards her, in consequence of a
difference of opinion as to an engagement to dance. As
soon as I had conducted her home I sent Mr. George a
challenge. Page McCarty acted as my friend, in the matter;
and part of his plan of action was to have the ground for
the combat on the other side of Hollywood Cemetery, so
that the duelists would have the satisfaction of passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
through or around the Cemetery on their way to the place
of meeting. Page told me, with his peculiar drawl, that he
knew I could stand it, and he thought it might unsettle the
nerves of the other fellow. The whole of the arrangements
had been made, and we were to fight the next morning,
when some cool headed friend (I do not remember who it
was), intervened, and the difficulty was adjusted, as it
ought to have been. There was so little expectation of a
settlement that I made a visit to Miss Jennie Cooper, the
daughter of Adjutant-General Cooper, late in the evening,
and communicated to her my last wishes; and gave her my
watch to take care of, and dispose of, in the event that the
walk through the Cemetery should not have the expected
effect upon Mr. George’s nerves. My experience with Miss
Haxall prompts me to say that an attractive girl is exceedingly
dangerous to the peace of mind of any one whom she
may undertake to instruct in the round dances. The crisis
was brought on, I believe, by some tableaux for the
benefit of the Memorial Association, or something of that
kind. In the tableaux Miss Mary was “Cleopatra” and I
was a Confederate soldier lying dead on the battle-field,
wearing for the occasion the uniform coat of Major McGraw,
who was a Lieutenant in the Purcell Battery in 1862, when
I joined it, and had risen to the rank of Major and lost an
arm in the service. It was the morning after the tableaux
that I became engaged to Miss Mary, and presented her
with a gold brooch which exhausted my pocket money, and
on which brooch her initials and mine were tenderly
scratched with the point of a pin. In less than a fortnight
the play was over. But when I returned to Richmond,
from Orange, I went to see Miss Mary and her
sister Miss Lottie Haxall, who were then making a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Mr. Conway Robinson, their uncle, who lives near the
Soldier’s Home at Washington. Miss Lottie Haxall, the
younger sister of Miss Mary, was a thoroughly high-bred
girl in every way, and noble in every phase of her character.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVII" id="XXXVII">XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>I had pretty well made up my mind to leave the <cite>Dispatch</cite>
if I should receive an offer of employment elsewhere. There
was no prospect of advancement in the <cite>Dispatch</cite> office, and
I was very much disgusted by the intention of the proprietors
to stop my pay during my absence on account of
my illness, contracted in their service. When I returned to
Richmond I was sent for by Colonel Briscoe G. Baldwin,
who had been Chief Ordnance officer of General Lee’s army,
and had been appointed Superintendent of the National
Express Company. He told me he wanted me to take a
position under him in the National Express Company.
This company was organized after the war as a rival of the
Southern Express Company, and had been something of a
hospital for Confederate officers of high rank. It was at
this time in a tottering condition; but Colonel Baldwin
said he thought it was not too late to save it, if he could
get such men as he wanted to do the active work of the
Company. He did not pretend to hide the condition of the
Company from me, but told me that he desired to have me
there and thought that it would be a good place for me, as,
if the Company did pull through its difficulties, I would be
on the sure road to promotion. I resigned from the <cite>Dispatch</cite>,
and on September 17th, 1866, I was appointed Route
Agent in the National Express and Transportation Company,
“with all the rights, privileges, authority, and duties
attaching to the position.” My salary was one hundred
dollars a month, and the Company paid my travelling
expenses. The territory which I was to supervise covered
the lines of railroad from Richmond to Alexandria in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
direction, and from Richmond to Bristol, Tennessee, in the
other. I went out on the road at once, visiting the agents
at every depot, and examining into the condition of the
business. There was great confusion everywhere, and the
railroads were threatening to discontinue taking freight
for us, as the Company did not pay the charges promptly.
One of the places that I visited was Lexington, where I had
the great happiness of seeing General R. E. Lee and his daughters
again. I saw General Lee only once after this, and that
was when he visited Charleston not long before he died.
Engaged as he was with visitors, he gave me, in kindly
remembrance of my services with his nephew, General Fitzhugh
Lee, a private interview, in order that my wife, Virginia,
might be presented to him. General Lee’s youngest
son, Robert E. Lee, married Miss Lottie Haxall. I heard
after I left Richmond that they would probably become
engaged, but I lost sight of Miss Lottie until 1872, when I
heard that Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Lee, who were newly married,
were staying at Aiken. Assuming that Mrs. Lee must be my
old friend Miss Lottie, I wrote to her and begged her to come
to Charleston. A night or two afterwards I was at the theatre
in Charleston, and as I looked at the audience I saw her
sparkling face turned towards me and smiling recognition.
The next day Mr. and Mrs. Lee spent with me and my wife,
and we went down to Fort Sumter together. It was the
last time that my wife went out; and only two or three
months afterwards Lottie Lee died of consumption.
Almost the last words that my wife, Virginia, who died in
1872, said to me before her death were: “When I die, I
shall see Lottie again.”</p>

<p>I also had the opportunity of visiting Warrenton, where
I spent a day with General W. H. Payne, whom I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
seen since we bade each other good-bye when he was
wounded at Five Forks. General Lomax was living near
Warrenton, and we had a glorious day reviving the memories
of our service in the cavalry. The National Express
Company, however, was on its last legs, and when I reached
Richmond in October I found that it had been determined
to wind up the concern. So ended my career as an
expressman. While on one of my tours of inspection, and
waiting at a wayside station for the train, I wrote the following
verses:</p>

<p>Riordan did not remain long with the <cite>Examiner</cite> after I
left it, and had been at work in Washington. Occasionally
he wrote to me, and assured me that he had not given up
the newspaper project for Charleston, and that he would
put a “peg in” in that direction whenever he had an opportunity.
With this in view, he accepted a position offered
him on the Charleston <cite>Courier</cite>, and went back to Charleston.
In October, Colonel R. Barnwell Rhett was preparing
to resume the publication of the <cite>Mercury</cite>, and asked Riordan
to take his old place on that paper. Riordan declined
to do this, and advised Colonel Rhett to take me if I would
come. It was only a day or two after I had finished my
work with the National Express Company that I received a
letter from Riordan, telling me what he had done; and on
the heels of his letter came a telegram from Colonel Rhett,
offering me an engagement on the <cite>Mercury</cite> and asking me
to come to Charleston immediately. There was nothing to
require me to remain in Richmond, so I accepted Colonel
Rhett’s offer, and after a round of leave-taking started for
Charleston, where I arrived on November 10th, 1866.</p>

<p>My first visit was to Riordan, whom I found in the <cite>Courier</cite>
office in East Bay Street. The next day I went to work in
the <cite>Mercury</cite> office, and remained on that paper until Riordan
and I bought one-third of the Charleston <cite>News</cite> <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in the autum'">in the
autumn</ins> of 1867. On May 1, 1867, I was married to Miss
Virginia Fourgeaud, a faithful and loving wife. Her health
unhappily failed fast, and she died in December, 1872.</p>

<p>In the waning fortunes of the Charleston <cite>News</cite> was the
opportunity that we had long desired of becoming managers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of a newspaper of our own; an object which Riordan
had kept unflaggingly in view from the moment that he had
first talked the project over with me in the <cite>Examiner</cite> office
at Richmond. It was his foresight, of course, in seizing the
opportunity to bring me to Charleston, that put us both in
the position to take the chance which was presented to us
by the decline of the Charleston <cite>News</cite>. The paper had
been exceedingly successful under extravagant and careless
management, and we could not, of course, expect to obtain
control of it until those who were managing it in Charleston
were willing to give it up. Captain James F. McMillan
and Mr. R. S. Cathcart had been controlling the paper. Cathcart
withdrew, and the condition of the paper grew worse.
It was heavily in debt, and the proprietors of the <cite>Courier</cite>
and <cite>Mercury</cite> looked cheerfully forward to the time when it
should quietly expire. We found that the real owner of
the property was Mr. Benjamin Wood, of New York, and
Riordan went on to New York to open negotiations with
him. This ended in Mr. Wood buying out Mr. McMillan,
and in our purchasing one-third of the property at the rate
of $18,000 for the whole. The new concern, of which
Benjamin Wood was a member, as the representative of
Henry Evans, a person in his employment, assumed all
the liabilities of the old concern. Riordan and I, therefore,
found ourselves owners of one-third of a newspaper which had
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> circulation of twenty-five hundred, or three thousand,
copies daily, with debts amounting to nearly $20,000,
and property consisting of two very old presses, a broken
down engine, and a suit of badly worn type. But we
were very cheerful about it, and our confident expectation
was that, in about five years, we should be able to retire
from newspaper work, in part, and live at our ease on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
property we had accumulated. It did not turn out exactly
in that way; but, as all the subsequent operations of the
concern are set forth in general terms in the record of
the litigation in which we were involved by Mr. Wood’s
rascality, it is not necessary to describe them here. I
should, however, record the fact, that the money with
which I paid for my share of the paper was borrowed from
Mr. W. J. Magrath. He advised me strongly against embarking
in the venture, but, when I insisted upon doing
so, he gave me every assistance in his power.</p>

<p>Some day, perhaps, I may undertake to write the inside
history of my connection with the Charleston <cite>News</cite>, and
<span class="smcap">The News and Courier</span>, and give my experiences in
South Carolina politics from 1867 down to the present time.
But I cannot do it now; and, indeed, I am too near to the
events, and to the persons I should describe, to write as
candidly as would be necessary to bring out the whole truth,
and make it entirely clear. It would be, I fancy&mdash;if I had
the time to refresh my memory, by looking over the newspapers
for the last fifteen years&mdash;a narrative, in its way,
quite as interesting, to my friends at least, as the incidents
of Confederate service which I have attempted to portray.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in bearing testimony to the authenticity of the accompanying
record, as furnished by Captain F. W. Dawson, whilst he was under my command
on board of the C. S. Steamer <i>Nashville</i>; and I do most earnestly recommend
him to the favorable consideration of the Committee on Applications, as
one eminently entitled, by his efficient services, to enjoy all the advantages and
honors of a Survivor.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson offered his services to the Confederate cause on board the
C. S. Steamer <i>Nashville</i>, at Southampton, England, December, 1861, in any
capacity I might designate. He was under age at the time, being about 17 or
18 years old; for this reason I declined to take him away from his home and
friends to set him adrift in a foreign land then engaged in a bloody war.</p>

<p>A few days before sailing from Southampton, duty called me to London, and
Dawson, taking advantage of my absence, assumed the garb of a sailor boy, and
was enlisted by the First Lieutenant on board the <i>Nashville</i>. I did not know
that he was on board until we were at sea, and was so surprised at seeing him
that I called him to enquire how he had thus gotten the weather-gage of me?
He replied, he was determined to espouse the Confederate cause at all hazards,
even by smuggling himself on board, if indispensable to attain his object.</p>

<p>During the voyage of the <i>Nashville</i> homeward, the admirable conduct of
young Dawson attracted my attention, and that of all the officers; and such
favorable reports were made to me of his zeal in the discharge of every duty
required of him, that I determined to give him an acting appointment of Master’s
Mate in the C. S. Navy, which appointment was promptly confirmed by
the Honorable Secretary of the Navy, upon my recommendation, when the
<i>Nashville</i> arrived at Beaufort, N. C.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson was attached to a vessel of the James River Squadron at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
time that General McClellan made his advance upon Richmond, yet such was
his anxiety to engage in the battle, that he offered his services as a volunteer to
the officer in command of the Purcell Battery. He was taken from the field
of battle at Mechanicsville badly wounded, but remained fighting his gun until
the close of the action, when, from loss of blood, he was completely prostrated.
Mr. Dawson’s bravery on this occasion, elicited the admiration of his Captain,
who went with me to the Hon. G. W. Randolph, then Secretary of War, to
request that he might be appointed a Lieutenant in the C. S. Army. The
request was readily granted as a reward of merit.</p>

<p>Though suffering from a painful wound, Mr. Dawson did not remain idle.
An invitation had been issued by the Secretary of War to the junior officers of
the army, to propose for admission into the Ordnance Corps. An examination
was ordered; and when the Board of Examiners met, Mr. Dawson was examined
and passed with distinction, and was commissioned in the Corps of Ordnance.
His career of duty in that branch of the service is better known to the
officers of the army with whom he served than to myself: though I have watched
his course with great satisfaction, and always felt a profound interest in his
advancement and welfare, having long since forgiven him for his tact in weathering
an old sailor.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
